"  Description: This file contains resource configuration information for the
"               latex-suite package.
" 
"        NOTE: Do NOT be edit this file directly:
"              this file will be over-written each time you install a new copy
"              of latex-suite. 
"
"              You can do one of the following:
"              1. Copy this file into $VIMFILES/ftplugin/tex/texrc
"                 and edit the values in that file.
"                 $VIMFILES is ~/.vim for UNIX systems and ~/vimfiles for
"                 WINDOWS systems.
"
"              2. Just set values of each setting individually in your
"                 $VIMFILES/ftplugin/tex.vim file. (See above for what
"                 $VIMFILES is). You will need to use :let instead of :TexLet
"                 in this case.
"
"        NOTE: This file is best viewed with Vim-6.0+ with folding turned on.

" Environment Macros: {{{

"           <++>
"       \end{center}<++>
" with the cursor left at the first place-holder.
" (See |placeholders| for what these are.)
" Mnemonic:
" 1. All environment mappings begin with 'E'
" 2. If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words, such as flushright
"    (flush + right), then the next 2 letters are the first letters of the 2
"    words. Example:  >
"        flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---> EFL
"        flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---> EFR
"        minipage   (_m_ini  + _p_age)  ---> EMP
"    If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken up into 2
"    distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the first 2 letters of the name
"    of the environment. Example:  >
"        equation (_eq_uation)          ---> EEQ
"
"    Please see texmaps.vim for the complete list.
" 
" Along with the insert mode mappings, a set of visual mode mappings is
" provided which encloses the visually selected region in an environment.
" These maps are related to the corresponding insert mode mappings by the
" following rule:
"     EFI           --> ,fi
" and so on. i.e, the leading E becomes '`' and the next 2 letters are small
" case. Some of the visual mode mappings are sensetive to whether you choose
" line-wise or character wise. For example, if you choose a word and press
" `ve, then you get \verb|word|, whereas if you press `ve on a line-wise
" selection, you get:
"       \begin{verbatim}
