Latex-Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to view, edit and
compile LaTeX documents in Vim. Together, they provide tools starting from
macros to speed up editing LaTeX documents to functions for forward searching
.dvi documents. Latex-suite has been possible because of the contributions of
many people. Please see |latex-suite-credits| for a list of people who have
helped.

{Vi of course does not have any of this}
NOTE: If you are viewing this in vim 6.0+, then the sections should appear
      folded (see |folding|). Use |za| to toggle back and forth between open
      and closed views.
NOTE: If the sections do not appear folded, press za in normal mode. This will
      fold up everything and it will be much easier to navigate.

OVERVIEW                               *latex-suite-overview* {{{

                                             *latex-suite-optimal-settings*
Latex-Suite works best if you have the following settings in your ~/.vimrc:
>
    " this line is responsible for loading latex-suite when a .tex file is
    " opened.
<   filetype plugin on >
    " for automatic indentation specific to LaTeX.
<   filetype indent on >

In addition, the following settings could go in your ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim
file:  >

    " this is mostly a matter of taste. but LaTeX looks good with just a bit
    " of indentation.
<   set sw=2 >
    " TIP: if you write your \label's as \label{fig:something}, then if you
    " type in \ref{fig: and press <C-n> you will automatically cycle through

The tools which are included in LaTeX suite can be grouped together into the
following. Almost every feature described here can be customized to some
degree. Please see the included file latex-suite/texrc file for the complete
list of variables which can be customized.

TABLE OF CONTENTS                                         *latex-suite-toc*
                                                          
|latex-macros|      Insert and visual mode mappings and menu items for
                    commonly used LaTeX typesetting elements 

|latex-compiling|   This version of latex-suite ships with a version of the
                    compiler specification which produces slightly less
                    verbose output. It can also be dynamically re-configured
                    to change the verbosity level.

|latex-viewing|     This is a set of functions which open up the compiled .dvi
                    document using the specified DVI viewer.

|latex-searching|   Xdvi (for UNIX) and Yap (for Windows) both provide ways
                    for "forward searching" LaTeX documents. This section
                    describes how to use these features and how to set up your
                    dvi viewer to best use this feature.

|latex-folding|     manual folding based on LaTeX syntax elements. 

|latex-packages|    This module provides a way to generate custom menus based
                    on the packages used in the file being edited.

|latex-templates|   Custom templates

|latex-macros|      Custom macros

|latex-help|        LaTeX's tex-info file translated into a vim help file.

|latex-dictionary|  A dictionary of standard LaTeX terms.

|latex-tools|       This version of latex-suite also ships with 2 external
                    tools:
                    1. |vimlatex| an external utility which filters the output
                       of the LaTeX compiler in order to ensure a more robust
                       error-parsing.
                    2. |ltags| A script to generate a tags file. It recognizes
                       files being \input'ed into a main file.
                       (ltags is written by Dimitri Antoniou)

LATEX MACROS                                   *latex-macros* {{{

Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and visual mode
mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX elements. 

We use a "macro" to refer to the collection of 3 objects, an insert mode
mapping, a visual mode mapping and a menu item. For example, a figure macro
refers to the insert mode mapping 'EFI', the visual mode mapping ',fi' and the
menu item Tex-Environments.figure.

For environments, sections and fonts, the insert mode mappings are a sequence
of 3 capital letters. The visual mode mapping follows from the insert mode
mapping by replacing the first character by a comma (',') (for environments
and sections) or back-tick ('`') (for fonts) and converting the rest to lower
case. >
              | Insert Mode   |  Visual Mode
 -------------+---------------+-------------
 environmnts  |    EFI        |    ,fi
 fonts        |    FSF        |    `sf

The menu item also specifies the insert and visual mode macros. The menus
behave differently from the insert mode macros in that they ask questions on
the command line in a "wizard" sort of manner and then generate a template
which includes the information gathered.  By contrast, the insert mode macros
do not ask any questions and generate a template with |placeholders| at each
input location.

                                              *placeholders* *placeholder*
                                              *place-holder* *place-holders*
NOTE: All these macros implement Stephen Riem's bracketing system and Gergely
Kontra's JumpFunc() for handling place-holders. This consists of using
"place-holders" to mark off locations where the next relevant editing has to
be done. As an example, when the user types in "EFI" in insert mode, she will
get the following: >

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centerline{\psfig{figure=«eps file»}}
        \caption{«caption text»}
        \label{fig:«label»}
    \end{figure}«»
<
The text «eps file» will be selected and she will be left in |select-mode| so
that she can continue typing straight away. After having typed in the file
name, she can press Control-J (while still in insert-mode). This will take her
directly to the next "place-holder". i.e, the «caption text» will be visually
selected with vim in select mode again for typing in the caption. This saves
on a lot of key presses.

NOTE: Furthermore these mappings are are not standard mappings in the sense
that only the last character is mapped. See plugin/imaps.vim for further
documentation. For example, in the example above, you can press the characters
'E', 'F' and 'I' as slowly as you wish. The characters are visible as you type
them and you can use the movement or backspace key to correct yourself unlike
normal mappings.

The macros can be divided into the following main categories:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment Mappings {{{

These mappings insert LaTeX "environments" such as >
      \begin{center}
          «»
      \end{center}«»
with the cursor left at the first |placeholder|.
(The environment above is generated by typing ECE in insert mode)

Rule for remembering shortcuts:
-------------------------------
1. All environment mappings begin with 'E'

2. If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words, such as
   flushright (flush + right), then the next 2 letters are the first letters
   of the 2 words.
   Example: >
        flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---> EFL
        flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---> EFR
        eqnarray   (_e_qn + _a_rray)   ---> EEA

<  If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken up into 2
   distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the first 2 letters of the name
   of the environment.
   Example: >
        equation (_eq_uation)          ---> EEQ

Of course, not every last one of the environments can follow this rule because
of ambiguities. In case of doubt, pull down the Tex-Environments menu. The
menu item should give the hint for the map.

Along with the insert mode mappings, a set of visual mode mappings is
provided which encloses the visually selected region in an environment.
These maps are related to the corresponding insert mode mappings by the
following rule: >
    ECE           --> ,ce
and so on. i.e, the leading E becomes ',' and the next 2 letters are small
case. Some of the visual mode mappings are sensetive to whether you choose
line-wise or character wise. For example, if you choose a word and press
,ce, then you get \centerline{word}, whereas if you press ,ce on a line-wise
selection, you get: >
      \begin{center}
          line
      \end{center}

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Font Mappings: {{{

These mappings insert font descriptions such as: >
      \textsf{«»}«»
again with the cursor at the first place-holder.

Mnemonic:

1. first letter is always F (F for font)
2. next 2 letters are the 2 letters describing the font.

Example: the above mapping is triggered by FSF.

Just like environment mappings, you can visually select an area and press
`sf to have it enclosed in: >
      \textsf{word}
or >
      {\sffamily
      line
      }
depending on character-wise or line-wise selection.

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section Mappings: {{{ 

Inserts LaTeX sections: >
      \section
etc. Just as in the case of environments and fonts, can be enclosed with a
visual selection. The enclosing is not sensetive to character or line-wise
selection.

Mnemonic: (make your own!) >
      SPA for part
      SCH for chapter
      SSE for section
      SSS for subsection
      SS2 for subsubsection
      SPG for paragraph
      SSP for subparagraph

Example:
    SSE in insert mode inserts >
        \section{«»}«»
<   If you select a word or line and press `se, then you get >
        \section{section name}
<   The menu item in Tex-Environments.Sections have a sub-menu called
    'Advanced'. Choosing an item from this sub-menu asks a couple of questions
    (whether you want to include the section in the table of contents, whether
    there is a shorter name for the table of contents) and then creates a more
    intelligent template.

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUC-TEX key bindings: {{{ 

These are simple 2 key expansions for some very commonly used LaTeX elements.
   Examples: >

	`^   expands to   \hat{«»}«»
	`_   expands to   \bar{«»}«»
	`6   expands to   \partial
	`8   expands to   \infty
	`/   expands to   \frac{«»}{«»}«»
	`%   expands to   \frac{«»}{«»}«»
	`@   expands to   \circ
	`0   expands to   ^\circ
	`=   expands to   \equiv
	`\   expands to   \setminus
	`.   expands to   \cdot
	`*   expands to   \times
	`&   expands to   \wedge
	`-   expands to   \bigcap
	`+   expands to   \bigcup
	`(   expands to   \subset
	`)   expands to   \supset
	`<   expands to   \le
	`>   expands to   \ge
	`,   expands to   \nonumber
	`~   expands to   \tilde{«»}«»
	`;   expands to   \dot{«»}«»
	`:   expands to   \ddot{«»}«»
	`2   expands to   \sqrt{«»}«»
	`|   expands to   \Big|
	`I   expands to   \int_{«»}^{«»}«»"
<   
    (again, notice the convenient place-holders)

In addition the visual mode macros are provided:
>
    `(  encloses selection in \left( and \right)
    `[  encloses selection in \left[ and \right]
    `{  encloses selection in \left\{ and \right\}
    `$  encloses selection in $$ or \[ \] depending on characterwise or
                                          linewise selection

NOTE: There is no menu item for these mappings. (as of this writing).

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diacritics: (by Lubomir Host) {{{

Diacritics speed up typing European languages.

>
    +<l>     expands to \v{<l>}
    =<l>     expands to \'{<l>}
<   where <l> is a letter ('a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z')
>
    +}       expands to \"{a} 
    +:       expands to \^{o} 
<
Latex-Suite also ships with a function SmartBS(), which offers another
convinience, i.e diacritic characters are treated as a single character for
backspacing.

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greek Letters:  {{{
>
   Lower case:
        `a   through `z expand to \alpha through \zeta.
    Upper case:
	    `D = \Delta
	    `F = \Phi
	    `G = \Gamma
	    `Q = \Theta
	    `L = \Lambda
	    `X = \Xi
	    `Y = \Psi
	    `S = \Sigma
	    `U = \Upsilon
	    `W = \Omega

NOTE: LaTeX does not support upper case for all greek alphabets.

This menu contains over 600 commands for inserting math signs into LaTeX
document. They are grouped into submenus as: Arrows, MathFonts, Greek
(letters), BinaryRel(ations) and many others. At the top are basic signs
leading into math mode. Some of symbols have hints for mappings in AUC-TeX
style.

LATEX COMPILING                             *latex-compiling* {{{ 

This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite menu.

Latex-suite ships with a set of tools to compile LaTeX files into various
formats and view them. 

If you are using commonly used LaTeX tools, then you should be all set as soon
as you download and install latex-suite.  In order to compile a LaTeX file,
simply press \ll while editing the file.  This runs latex on the current file
and displays the errors in a |quickfix-window|. You can then scroll through
the errors and press <enter> to be taken to the location of the corresponding
error.

|latex-compiler-target|         : specifying a different target format for
                                  compilation.
|latex-suite-compiler|          : specifying a diffrent compiler.
|latex-master-file|             : specifying a different file for compilation
                                  instead of file being edited.
|latex-compiler-customization|  : customizing the output of the
                                  latex-compiler.

                                                     *latex-compiler-target*
In order to effectively use latex-suite to compile and view formats other than
DVI, you will need to edit the |texrc| file and set the variables:
>
    g:Tex_CompileRule_<format>
    g:Tex_ViewRule_<format>

where <format> is a string like "pdf", "dvi" etc. These variables define
``rules'' for compiling and viewing the corresponding target.

Example: In texrc, the compilation rule for dvi is by default: >
    g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex --interaction=nonstopmode $*'

Default values are also provided for ps and pdf formats. You might want to
change these rules in texrc according to your local tex environment.

Once a ``rule'' has been set up for a format, you can set the target format by
using the {TeX-Suite.Target Format} menu item. Alternatively, you can use the
|:TTarget| command. You can also set the viewer and compiler to different
formats, by using the menu items or using the commands |:TCTarget| and
|:TVTarget|. 

NOTE: If you try choosing a format for which a rule is not defined, you
will get a short warning message and no action will be taken.

NOTE: Specifying a different format does not automatically account for
dependencies. For example, if in your case you do:
    .tex -> .dvi -> .ps -> .pdf
then you will need to choose dvi first, compile, change format to ps, compile,
change format and so on.

                                                    *latex-suite-compiler*
The simplest way to choose a different compiler is to edit the >
    g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi
variable.

If however, you are only using the compiler/tex.vim module from latex-suite,
there are a couple of other ways to change things.

Just as in the case of the standard tex compiler, ``if b:tex_flavor or
g:tex_flavor (in this precedence) variable exists, it defines TeX flavor for
:make (actually, this is the name of executed command), and if both variables
do not exist, it defaults to "latex"'' (from |compiler-tex|)

NOTE: For win32 users user MikTeX, sometimes the latex compiler's output has a
bug where a single number is split across different lines. In this case, put
the included vimlatex utility somehwere in your $PATH, make it executable and
point g:tex_flavor to it. This is not always necessary, and you might want to
try it without vimlatex till you first notice any problem.

                                                        *latex-master-file*
Often times the file you are currently editing is only a fragment being
\input'ed into a master tex file. In such cases you will need to do create a
dummy file in the directory containing the current file. This dummy file is of
the form:
>
    <mailfilename>.latexmain

In other words, if the current file is ~/thesis/chapter.tex, where
chapter.tex is being \input'ed into ~/thesis/main.tex, then create a file
called >
    main.tex.latexmain 
< 
in the ~/thesis directory. This will then run "latex main.tex"
NOTE: Here main.tex.latexmain is a different file from main.tex itself.
main.tex need not be renamed. The contents of main.tex.latexmain are not used.
This ofcourse restricts each directory to have a single master file.

                                               *latex-compiler-customization*
Latex-suite ships with a modified (enhanced ?) version of the standard tex
compiler plugin maintained by Artem Chuprina. The modifications allow this
version to be customizable. i.e the user can set a verbosity level for the
compiler. 

By default it is set up in a "non-verbose", "ignore-common-warnings" mode,
which means that irrelevant lines from the compilers output will be
ignored and also some very common warnings are ignored.

Depending on the "ignore-level", (which can be set with the command TCLevel as
described below) the following kinds of messages are ignored.  An ignore level
of 3 for instance means that messages of type 1-3 will be ignored. By default,
the ignore level is set to 4. (You can change this by setting
g:Tex_IgnoreLevel in your .vimrc). 

1. LaTeX Warning: Underfull box ...
2. LaTeX Warning: Overfull box ...
   both these warnings (very common) are due to \hbox settings not being
   satisfied nicely.
3. LaTeX Warning: Specifier 'h' changed to 't'. 
   This errors occurs when TeX is not able to correctly place a floating
   object at a specified location, because of which it defaulted to the
   top of the page.
4. LaTeX Warning: You have requested ..., 
   This warning occurs in slitex when using the xypic package.
5. Missing number error:
   Usually, when the name of an included eps file is spelled incorrectly,
   then the \bb-error message is accompanied by a bunch of "missing
   number, treated as zero" error messages. This level ignores these
   warnings.
   NOTE: number 5 is actually a LaTeX error, not a warning!

Use >

    TCLevel <level>

where level is a number to set the ignore level dynamically. This will re-do
the 'efm' so that next time you do \ll, you will not be shown those kinds of
warnings. Use "TCLevel 0" to ignore no warnings at all, but still remain in a
"non-verbose", i.e ignore unmatched lines mode.

When TCLevel is called with the unquoted string strict as >

    TClevel strict

then the 'efm' switches to a "verbose", "no-lines-ignored" mode which is
useful when you want to make final checks of your document and want to be
careful not to let things slip by.

You can also choose to ignore other kinds of patterns by setting
g:IgnoreWarnings in your ~/.vimrc. This is a '¡' seperated list of commands.
Its default value is: >
	let g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings =
		\'Underfull¡'.
		\'Overfull¡'.
		\'specifier changed to¡'.
		\'You have requested¡'.
		\'Missing number, treated as zero.'

LATEX VIEWING AND SEARCHING                   *latex-viewing* {{{

Latex-suite ships with a set of functios for viewing .dvi files generated by
LaTeX. Press \lv while viewing a tex file. This will start the dvi viewer on
your system and display the current file in it. If the variable g:DviViewer
exists, then it is used as the program for viewing DVI files, otherwise it
defaults to yap for windows or xdvi for unix.
NOTE: These programs are called with some additional arguments. If you DVI
viewer doesnt accept these, then you will need to change the code itself. This
will be configurable by a variable in the future.

Like in the case of the compiler, you can specify the master file for the
current file (see |latex-master-file|)

                                                       *latex-searching*
Yap for windows and some versions of xdvi for windows provide the ability to
do "forward searching" on the .dvi file. This means that you can have the DVI
viewer jump to a specified location. 

Pressing \ls while viewing a LaTeX file will perform this function, i.e the
viewer will jump to the location under the cursor.

NOTE: MikTeX requires that the dvi file be generated using the --src-specials
flag in order to enable forward/reverse searching. By default, latex-suite
will call LaTeX with this argument on windows (where yap is assumed).

These functions were added after a tip from Dimitri Antoniou on vim.sf.net.
See >
   http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip.php?tip_id=225
for a description on how to get xdvik/yap to play along with Vim.

LATEX FOLDING                                 *latex-folding* {{{

Latex-suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a plugin for
creating "fake" syntax folds on the fly. The fold method is actually manual
but the folding is based on LaTeX syntax. This offers a speed increase over
regular syntax folding. Ofcourse it has the disadvantage that the folds are
not dynamic, i.e newly created syntax items are not automatically folded up.
(This is a compromise between speed and convinience).

When you open up a LaTeX file, all the portions will be automatically folded
up. However, no new folds will be created until you press <F6> or \rf. (rf
stands for "refresh folds").

The fold-text is set to the first line of the folded text unless the fold is a
table, figure etc. (an environment). In this case, if a \caption and/or a
label is found in the folded region, then those are used to make a more
meaningful fold-tex, otherwise the second line of the environment is displayed
along with the name of the environment. In other words, the following >

    \begin{figure}[h]
      \centerline{\psfig{figure=slidercrank.eps,height=6cm}}
      \caption{The Slider Crank Mechanism.}
      \label{fig:slidercrank}

This module provides ways of customizing the menus based on which packages
are being used in the current LaTeX file. When latex-suite first starts up, it
scans the |latex-master-file| for >
    \usepackage{name}
lines and if the corresponding package is found in the latex-suite/packages/
directory, then creates a sub-menu based on the specification found in that
file.

                                                  *latex-package-dictionary*
Furthermore, if a file with the same name is found in the
latex-suite/dictionaries/ directory, then that file will be added to vim's
'dictionary' setting for use with the |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K| command.  Package
dictionary file should follow outlines specified in 'dictionary'.


                                                        *latex-package-file*
A latex-package-file is a simple vim script which defines some global
variables. These global variables are used by latex-suite to create the custom
menu. See the |latex-package-file-writing| section how to define a customized
package file.

If you do make a package file for latex-suite, please consider contacting the
|latex-suite-maintainer|.

Example: 

From the packages menu, choose the >
    Tex-Packages.Supported.SIunits 
option. This will insert a line of form: >
    \usepackage[«»]«»{SIunits}«»
at the beginning of the file (with the cursor placed at the first
|placeholder|. You will also notice that the packages menu now contains a
sub-menu called SIunits, which contains the commands and options for the
SIunits package.You can use this sub-menu to insert commands from the package,
add options to the package etc.
    
NOTE: Since the package file is a vim-script, you could define custom
functions there, add mappings etc.

You can perform the following actions via the packages menu:

{Update}           This command is to be invoked with the cursor placed on the
                   package name. If the corresponding package is found, then a
                   sub-menu with the supported commands, options is created.
                   A |latex-package-dictionary| might also be created.

{UpdateAll}        This function reads the preamble of the document for
                   \usepackage lines and if latexSuite supports the detected
                   packages, then sub-menus containing the package options and
                   commands is created. 
                   A |latex-package-dictionary| might also be created.

{Supported}        This sub-menu contains a list of all the package files stored in
                   latex-suite/packages directory. When you choose one of
                   these, a \usepackage{package_name} line will inserted in
                   the preamble of the |latex-master-file| and a sub-menu for
                   the package will be created.
                   If options are detected, then the inserted line is of the
                   form:
                        \usepackage[«»]{package_name}
                   A |latex-package-dictionary| might also be created.

                                               *latex-package-file-writing*
Writing package files is very easy and gives possibility of creating simple
templates with prefixes to command. Package file have to contain two
variables:
g:TeX_package_option_<package> and g:TeX_package_<package>

First contain package options, second various commands supplied with
<package>.

Package option variable: >
    g:TeX_package_option_<package> = "Option,Option2="
= at the end gives: >
    Option2=x,<<>>
Here is allowed one prefix:
{sbr:option} Breaks option menu into submenu. {option} is the name of submenu.

Package variable: >
    g:TeX_package_<package> = "pre:Command,pre:Command1"
More detailed example is in latex-suite/packages/exmpl file (slightly
outdated).
Here is short summary of prefixes which can be used in package files:
(x - place with cursor, <<>> - |placeholder|)

{env:command}  Environment: creates simple environment template >
            \begin{command}
                x 
            \end{command}<<>>
{eno:command}  Environment with option: >
            \begin[x]{command}
                <<>>
            \end{command}<<>>
{ens:command[<<option>>]...}  Environment special: >
            \begin[<<option>>]...{command}
                <<>>
            \end{command}<<>>
{bra:command} Brackets: >
            \command{x}<<>>
{brd:command} Brackets double: >
            \command{x}{<<>>}<<>>
{brs:command[<<option>>]...} Brackets special (as environment special: >
            \command[<<x>>]{<<>>}{<<>>}<<>>
{nor:command} Normal: >
            \command<Space>
{noo:command} Normal with option: >
            \command[x]<<>>
{nob:command} Normal with option and brackets: >
            \command[x]{<<>>}<<>>
{pla:command} Plain: >
            command<Space>
{spe:command} Special: >
            command   <-literal insertion of command
{sep:command} creates separator. Good for aesthetics and usability :)
{sbr:command} Breaks menu into submenus. <command> will be title of submenu.
            Can be used also in package variable.

Command can be also given without prefix:. The result is >
           \command

CUSTOM TEMPLATES                            *latex-templates* {{{

This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite.Templates menu.

This module provides a way to insert custom templates at the beginning of the
current file.

When latex-suite first starts up, it scans the latex-suite/templates/ directory
and creates menu items based on the files found there. When you select a
template from this menu, the file will be read in above the first line of the
current file. 

A template file can use |placeholders| for easy cursor movement. In addition,
you can use lines such as the following for inserting dates, names
dynamically: >
    %        File: ¡expand("%")¡

This will create a line of the form: >
    %       File: name.tex

if the current file name is name.tex.

NOTE: Templates are also accessible for non-gui users with the command
|:TexTemplate|. The argument should be name of the corresponding template
file.  If the command is called without arguments (preferred usage), then a
list of avaiable templates is displayed and the user is asked to choose one of
them.

You can ofcourse place your own templates in this directory.

}}}
===========================================================================
CUSTOM MACROS                           *latex-custom-macros* {{{

This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite.Macros menu.

This module provides a way of inserting customized macros into the current
file.

When latex-suite starts up, it scans the latex-suite/macros/ directory and
creates a menu from the files found there. Each file is considered as a single
macro. You can place your own macros in this directory, using |placeholders|
if wanted.

When you choose a macro from the menu, the corresponding file is read into the
current buffer after the current cursor position. In non-gui mode, you can
use the |TexMacro| command instead of choosing from the menu. This command
takes the macro file name as an argument. When called without arguments
(preferred usage), then a list of avaiable macro files is displayed and the
user is prompted to choose one of them).

There are some other tools provided in this menu, namely:

{New}            Creates a new (unnamed) buffer in the latex-suite/macros/
                 directory. 
                 Use the command :TexMacroNew in non-gui mode.

{Edit}           Opens up the corresponding macro file for editing.
                 Use :TexMacroEdit in non-gui mode.

{Delete}         Deletes the corresponding macro. 
                 Use the prefixed numbers for fast navigation of menus.
                 Use :TexMacroDelete in non-gui mode.

{Redraw}         Rescans the macros/ directory and refreshes the macros list.

}}}
===========================================================================
LATEX MENU CONFIGURATION           *latex-menu-configuration* {{{

                                                    *latex-menu-configure*

Generally latex-suite's menus should be configured by setting options in the
|texrc| file. But if you feel the need to change after startup, then use the
'TeX-Suite.Configure Menu' menu option to turn some of the menus off and on,
control the nested-ness of some of the menus etc.

}}}
===========================================================================
LATEX HELP                                       *latex-help*  {{{

latexhelp.txt is a collection of latex.info files `translated' into vim help
format. Now you can seek for help for specific LaTeX item without exiting vim.

Example: >
    :help \kill
gives help for the LaTeX \kill command.

In order to use this help file, you will need to run |:helptags| once after
you download and unzip latex-suite.

}}}
===========================================================================
LATEX DICTIONARY                           *latex-dictionary* {{{

Latex-suite ships with a dictionary of over 600 commands from LaTeX and
popular packages. When latex-suite starts up, it automatically adds this
dictionary to vim's 'dictionary' option for use with vim's |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K|
command. 

It is also possible to load custom dictionaries automatically when packages
load. This will happen if a package definition file >
    latex-suite/packages/package.vim
has a corrresponding dictionary >
    latex-suite/dictionaries/package


}}}
===========================================================================
LATEX SUITE COMMANDS                   *latex-suite-commands* {{{

LatexSuite defines set of commands for non-GUI and power users. They are
taking care about Macros, Templates and Packages.

:TMacro [{macro}]                      *TMacro*
                When used without any arguments lists all available macros
                defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompt you to
                choose one of them.
                With one argument |:read| this macro under cursor position.
                With more than one argument it will not work :)

:TMacroEdit [{macro}]                  *TMacroEdit*
                Splits window for editing {macro}.
                When used without any arguments lists all available macros
                defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompt you to
                choose one of them.

:TMacroNew                             *TMacroNew*
                Splits window to write new macro. Directory in new buffer is
                locally changed to latex-suite/macros/.

:TMacroDelete [{macro}]                *TMacroDelete*
                Delets {macro} from latex-suite/macros/ directory.
                When used without any arguments lists all available macros
                defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompt you to
                choose one of them.

:TPackage [{package} [{package} ...]]  *TPackage*
                When used without any arguments lists name of the packages for
                which support is available. Report depends if you are using
                GUI version and/or g:Tex_Menus is set to 1 or not. When you
                are not using menus command lists files from
                latex-suite/dictionaries/ (this is main support for non-menus
                version of latexSuite) if menus are on |TPackage| lists
                files from latex-suite/packages/ directory.

                When {package} is given command turns on all possible support
                for this {package} (|latex-menu-packages|,
                |latex-packages-dictionary|). Number of arguments separated
                with spaces is limited only with common sense.

:TPackageUpdate                        *TPackageUpdate*
                This command `reads' name of package under cursor and turns on
                possible support.

:TPackageUpdateAll                     *TPackageUpdateAll*
                After issuing this command latexSuite scans the file in
                looking for not declared packages, removing not needed entries
                from Packages menu and turning off not necessary packages'
                dictionaries.

:TTemplate [{template}]                *TTemplate*
                When used without any arguments lists all available templates
                from latex-suite/templates/ directory and prompts to choose
                one of them.
                With one argument :0|read| {template} file.
                With more than one argument it will not work :)

:TSection [{argument}]                 *TSection*
                Used without any arguments inserts last section type
                (|latex-sectioning|).
                Accepts arguments:
                <n>     inserts section name in <n> logical level.
                        Levels are:
                        0 part
                        1 chapter
                        2 section
                        3 subsection
                        4 subsubsection
                        5 paragraph
                        6 subparagraph

                +<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels above the last
                        used comand

                -<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels below the last
                        used comand

                +       inserts section name one logical level below the last
                        used command (equal to +1).

                ++      inserts section name two logical levels below the last
                        used command (equal to +2).

                -       inserts section name one logical level over the last
                        used command (equal to -1).

                --      inserts section name two logical levels over the last
                        used command (equal to -2).

                Command accepts also latexSuite mappings (|latex-macros|)
                without preceding S and in lowercase: >
                        :TSection pa 
<               will result in \part{}. It is possible to use full names of
                sections: >
                        :TSection part 
<
:TSectionAdvanced                      *TSectionAdvanced*
                Accepts the same arguments as |TSection| but leads to a couple
                of questions (whether you want to include the section in the
                table of contents, whether there is a shorter name for the
                table of contents) and then creates a more intelligent
                template.
