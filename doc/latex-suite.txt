Latex-Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to view, edit and
compile LaTeX documents in Vim. Together, they provide tools starting from
macros to speed up editing LaTeX documents to functions for forward searching
.dvi documents. Latex-suite has been possible because of the contributions of
many people. Please see |latex-suite-credits| for a list of people who have
helped.

Latex-suite is released under the Vim charityware license. For license and
conditions of use look at |copyright|. Replace all occurences of ``Vim'' with
``Latex-Suite''. The current copyright holders of Latex-Suite are Srinath
Avadhanula and Mikolaj Machowski.

{Vi of course does not have any of this}
NOTE: If you are viewing this in Vim 6.0+, then the sections should appear
      folded (see |folding|). Use |za| to toggle back and forth between open
      and closed views.
NOTE: If the sections do not appear folded, press za in normal mode. This will
      fold up everything and it will be much easier to navigate.

OVERVIEW                               *latex-suite-overview* {{{

                                             *latex-suite-optimal-settings*
Latex-Suite works best if you have the following settings in your ~/.vimrc:
>
    " this line is responsible for loading latex-suite when a .tex file is
    " opened.
<   filetype plugin on >
    " for automatic indentation specific to LaTeX.
<   filetype indent on >

In addition, the following settings could go in your ~/.vim/ftplugin/tex.vim
file:  >

    " this is mostly a matter of taste. but LaTeX looks good with just a bit
    " of indentation.
<   set sw=2 >
    " TIP: if you write your \label's as \label{fig:something}, then if you
    " type in \ref{fig: and press <C-n> you will automatically cycle through
    " all the figure labels. Very useful!
<   set iskeyword+=: >
    " IMPORTANT: If you are a win32 user, then the following setting is
    " necessary in order to have latex called correctly from within Vim.
<   set shellslash


The tools which are included in LaTeX suite can be grouped together into the
following. Almost every feature described here can be customized to some
degree. Please see the included file ftplugin/latex-suite/|texrc| file for the
complete list of variables which can be customized.

LATEX MACROS                                   *latex-macros* {{{

Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and
|visual-mode| mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX elements.

                                              *placeholders* *placeholder*
                                              *place-holder* *place-holders*
All these macros implement Stephen Riem's bracketing system and Gergely
Kontra's JumpFunc() for handling place-holders. This consists of using
"place-holders" to mark off locations where the next relevant editing has to
be done. As an example, when the user types in "EFI" in |insert-mode|, she
will get the following: >

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centerline{\psfig{figure=<+eps file+>}}
        \caption{<+caption text+>}
        \label{fig:<+label+>}
    \end{figure}<++>
<
The text <+eps file+> will be selected and she will be left in |select-mode| so
that she can continue typing straight away. After having typed in the file
name, she can press Control-J (while still in insert-mode). This will take her
directly to the next "place-holder". i.e, the <+caption text+> will be visually
selected with Vim in select mode again for typing in the caption. This saves
on a lot of key presses.

NOTE: These mappings are are not standard mappings in the sense that only the
last character is mapped. See plugin/imaps.vim for further documentation. For
example, in the example above, you can press the characters 'E', 'F' and 'I'
as slowly as you wish. The characters are visible as you type them and you can
use the movement or backspace key to correct yourself unlike normal mappings.

The macros can be divided into the following main categories:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment Mappings {{{

These mappings insert LaTeX "environments" such as >
      \begin{center}
          <++>
      \end{center}<++>
with the cursor left at the first |placeholder|. There are various ways of
inserting environments into the source file. If the environment is a standard
latex environment, then latex suite might also include common fields
associated with it.

Method 1:
    If you press <F5> in the insert mode while on an empty line, latex-suite
    prompts you with a list of environments you might want to insert. You can
    either choose one from the list or type in a new environment name. This
    list can be customized. See the 'Macros' section of the |texrc| file for
    details.

Method 2:
    If you press <F5> while on a line containing a single word, then
    latex-suite creates a environment of that name.

Method 3:
    The shifted function keys, <S-F1> to <S-F4> can also be optionally mapped
    to some common environments which you insert most often. The environments
    mapped to each key can also be customized. See the |texrc| file for
    details.

Method 4:
    Environments can also be inserted by pressing a 3 capital letter sequence
    starting with an E. The following subsection describes this in detail. The
    sequence of 3 letters generally tries to follow the following rules:

    1. All environment mappings begin with 'E'

    2. If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words, such as
       flushright (flush + right), then the next 2 letters are the first
       letters of the 2 words.
       Example: >
            flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---> EFL
            flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---> EFR
            eqnarray   (_e_qn + _a_rray)   ---> EEA

<      If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken up into 2
       distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the first 2 letters of the name
       of the environment.
       Example: >
            equation (_eq_uation)          ---> EEQ

<      Unfortunately there are some environments that cannot be split in two
       words and first two letters in name are identical. In this case
       shortcut is created from E, first and last letter.
       Example: >
            quote     (_q_uot_e_)          ---> EQE
            quotation (_q_uotatio_n_)      ---> EQN

<      Of course, not every last one of the environments can follow this rule
       because of ambiguities. In case of doubt, pull down the
       Tex-Environments menu. The menu item should give the hint for the map.

Along with the insert mode mappings, a set of visual mode mappings is
provided which encloses the visually selected region in an environment.
These maps are related to the corresponding insert mode mappings by the
following rule: >
    ECE           --> ,ce
and so on. i.e, the leading E becomes ',' and the next 2 letters are small
case. Some of the visual mode mappings are sensitive to whether you choose
line-wise or character wise. For example, if you choose a word and press
,ce, then you get \centerline{word}, whereas if you press ,ce on a line-wise
selection, you get: >
      \begin{center}
          line
      \end{center}

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Font Mappings: {{{

These mappings insert font descriptions such as: >
      \textsf{<++>}<++>
again with the cursor at the first place-holder.

Mnemonic:

1. first letter is always F (F for font)
2. next 2 letters are the 2 letters describing the font.

Example: the above mapping is triggered by FSF.

Just like environment mappings, you can visually select an area and press
`sf to have it enclosed in: >
      \textsf{word}
or >
      {\sffamily
      line
      }
depending on character-wise or line-wise selection.

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section Mappings: {{{

Inserts LaTeX sections: >
      \section
etc. Just as in the case of environments and fonts, can be enclosed with a
visual selection. The enclosing is not sensetive to character or line-wise
selection.

Mnemonic: (make your own!) >
      SPA for part
      SCH for chapter
      SSE for section
      SSS for subsection
      SS2 for subsubsection
      SPG for paragraph
      SSP for subparagraph

Example:
    SSE in insert mode inserts >
        \section{<++>}<++>
<   If you select a word or line and press ,se, then you get >
        \section{section name}
<   The menu item in Tex-Environments.Sections have a sub-menu called
    'Advanced'. Choosing an item from this sub-menu asks a couple of questions
    (whether you want to include the section in the table of contents, whether
    there is a shorter name for the table of contents) and then creates a more
    intelligent template.

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUC-TEX key bindings: {{{

These are simple 2 key expansions for some very commonly used LaTeX elements.
   Examples: >

	`^   expands to   \hat{<++>}<++>
	`_   expands to   \bar{<++>}<++>
	`6   expands to   \partial
	`8   expands to   \infty
	`/   expands to   \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>
	`%   expands to   \frac{<++>}{<++>}<++>
	`@   expands to   \circ
	`0   expands to   ^\circ
	`=   expands to   \equiv
	`\   expands to   \setminus
	`.   expands to   \cdot
	`*   expands to   \times
	`&   expands to   \wedge
	`-   expands to   \bigcap
	`+   expands to   \bigcup
	`(   expands to   \subset
	`)   expands to   \supset
	`<   expands to   \le
	`>   expands to   \ge
	`,   expands to   \nonumber
	`~   expands to   \tilde{<++>}<++>
	`;   expands to   \dot{<++>}<++>
	`:   expands to   \ddot{<++>}<++>
	`2   expands to   \sqrt{<++>}<++>
	`|   expands to   \Big|
	`I   expands to   \int_{<++>}^{<++>}<++>"
<
    (again, notice the convenient place-holders)

In addition the visual mode macros are provided:
>
    `(  encloses selection in \left( and \right)
    `[  encloses selection in \left[ and \right]
    `{  encloses selection in \left\{ and \right\}
    `$  encloses selection in $$ or \[ \] depending on characterwise or
                                          linewise selection

NOTE: There is no menu item for these mappings. (as of this writing).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diacritics: (by Lubomir Host - currently disabled by default in texrc) {{{

Diacritics speed up typing European languages.

>
    +<l>     expands to \v{<l>}
    =<l>     expands to \'{<l>}
<   where <l> is a letter ('a' to 'z' and 'A' to 'Z')
>
    +}       expands to \"{a}
    +:       expands to \^{o}
<
Latex-Suite also ships with a function SmartBS(), which offers another
convinience, i.e diacritic characters are treated as a single character for
backspacing.

}}}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greek Letters:  {{{
>
   Lower case:
        `a   through `z expand to \alpha through \zeta.
    Upper case:
	    `D = \Delta
	    `F = \Phi
	    `G = \Gamma
	    `Q = \Theta
	    `L = \Lambda
	    `X = \Xi
	    `Y = \Psi
	    `S = \Sigma
	    `U = \Upsilon

This menu contains over 600 commands for inserting math signs into LaTeX
document. They are grouped into submenus as: Arrows, MathFonts, Greek
(letters), BinaryRel(ations) and many others. At the top are basic signs
leading into math mode. Some of symbols have hints for mappings in AUC-TeX
style.

===========================================================================
LATEX SMART KEYS                           *latex-smart-keys* {{{

Latex suite ships with the following smart keys:

Smart Backspace
    Pressing <BS> in insert mode checks to see whether we are just after
    something like \'{a} and if so, deletes all of it. i.e, diacritics are
    treated as single characters for backspacing.

Smart Quotes
    Pressing " (english double quote) will insert `` or '' by making an
    intelligent guess about whether we intended to open or close a quote.

Smart Space
    Latex-suite maps the <space> key in such a way that $ characters are not
    broken across lines. It does this by first setting tw=0 so that Vim will
    not automatically break lines and then maps the <space> key to insert
    newlines keeping $$'s on the same line.

Smart Dots
    Pressing ... (3 dots) results in \ldots outside math mode and \cdots in
    math mode.

}}}
===========================================================================
LATEX COMPLETION                            *latex-completion* {{{

This module provides an easy way to insert references to labels and
bibliographic entries. Suppose you want to refer to an equation which is
labelled as "eqn:eq-1" using the \label{eqn:eq-1} command. Somewhere in the
text, you write "\ref{" with the cursor after the {. Now if you press <F9>,
Latex-suite will try to search through all the .tex files in the present
directory for lines beginning with "\label{". It will provide you with a list
of all such matches in two small windows.

+========================================================+
| I want to insert a reference to equation 1. Therefore  |
| I will write \ref{                                     |
|                                                        |

|And there was some text after this. I dont remember     |
+--------------------------------------------------------+
+file1.tex [Preview]                                     +
+========================================================+

The first window (shown as "[Error List]" above) is a |cwindow| containing a
list of matches and you will be left in it. The window beneath it is a
|preview-window| showing the context of the match. When you move up and down
in the "[Error List]" window, the preview window will be scrolled to keep in
sync with the label. Pressing the "J" and "K" keys in the "[Error List]"
window scrolls the preview window enabling you to see more context if you
desire. After positioning yourself on a label which you want to insert, press
<CR>. This will automatically close all the new windows, take you back to the
file being edited and insert the chosen label in place. Pressing "q" in the
"[Error List]" window closes all windows without inserting anything.

As can be seen above, the matches include everything which begins with \label.
If you have the habit of prefixing all equation labels with "eqn:" or
something similar, then you can restrict the matches to only equations by
first typing "\ref{eqn:" and then pressing <F9>. This only brings up matches
starting with "\label{eqn:" thus allowing you to skip table and figure labels.

The same mechanism also works with citations by pressing <F9> after typing
"\cite{". In the case of citations, Latex-suite automatically displays a list
of bibliographic entries found in .bib files in the present directory. 

This mechanism in fact works with all commands with "ref" or "cite" in them.
Thus you will get completion with \citen, \citenum or \pageref.  If you want
to create your own command which uses cite or ref mechanism make sure proper
word is inside it. Example: >

        \newcommand{\pref}[1]{~(p.~\pageref{#1})}
<

<F9> works also with normal words. You can use it as: "Its name is tetr<F9>".
Now Latex-suite will look in all .tex files in directory of edited file word
which is beginning with "tetr". Note: <cr> has here different behavior. It
does not try to complete word but moves you to location chosen in cwindow.

Under MS-Windows you may need to make additional configuration of 'grepgrg'
option. If you have grep program default value "grep -n" doesn't show file
names if there is only one matching file. Place >

    set grepprg=grep\ -Hn

in your _vimrc.

The functionality in this module is also available via three command-line
utilities: |TLook|, |TLookBib| and |TLookAll|.

You can use the g:Tex_ViewerCwindowHeight and g:Tex_ViewerPreviewHeight
options in texrc to configure the heights of the "[Error List]" and preview
window.

                                            *latex-completion-explorer*
Latex-suite is distributed with slightly changed explorer.vim. This
modification allows to perform custom operations in explorer buffer.

After \includegraphics{<F9> Latex-suite will open explorer buffer with current
directory or directory defined with g:Tex_ImageDir variable. When you choose
graphic file with <cr> its name will be inserted into file as bib key or
label. If g:Tex_ImageDir is set Latex-suite assume you also defined
\graphicspath{} command and will insert just file name (without extension). If
g:Tex_ImageDir is empty (default) it will put relative path to graphic file.

After \bibliography{<F9> Latex-suite will open explorer buffer with current
directory. After <cr> name of relative path to chosen file (without extension)
will be inserted.

In both cases explorer window will open with basic filter. You should not see
uninteresting in current context files.

You can regulate height of explorer window with g:Tex_ExplorerHeight variable
(default 10).

}}}
===========================================================================
CUSTOM TEMPLATES                            *latex-templates* {{{

This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite.Templates menu.

This module provides a way to insert custom templates at the beginning of the
current file.

When latex-suite first starts up, it scans the latex-suite/templates/ directory
and creates menu items based on the files found there. When you select a
template from this menu, the file will be read in above the first line of the
current file.

A template file can use |placeholders| for easy cursor movement. In addition,
you can use lines such as the following for inserting dates, names
dynamically: >
    %        File: ¡expand("%")¡

This will create a line of the form: >
    %       File: name.tex

if the current file name is name.tex.

NOTE: Templates are also accessible for non-gui users with the command
|:TexTemplate|. The argument should be name of the corresponding template
file.  If the command is called without arguments (preferred usage), then a
list of available templates is displayed and the user is asked to choose one of
them.

You can of course place your own templates in this directory.

}}}
===========================================================================
LATEX PROJECT                               *latex-project* {{{

LaTeX-suite is quite smart with looking for components of LaTeX document. In
simple projects which can be put in one, two or three directories LaTeX-suite
can find bibliography, included or image files. But it is impossible to guess
all combinations, especially in projects dispersed in many directories, in
deep levels. For such situations you can create projects.

Creating project

To create project file make sure you don't have *.latexmain file
(|latex-master-file|). Open file which is the skelet of your whole work. Use
|:TProjectEdit| command. It will create file "yourmainfile.tex.latexmain" and
read in template of project file. This is just Vim file. Now you have two
commented variables: g:projName and g:projFiles. First isn't obligatory. It
will be visible in Explorer window to show you are editing project. This is
list of files separated with commas. File/dir name cannot contain
spaces. Example: >

    let g:projFiles="main.tex,roz1/roz1.tex,roz1/roz1.bib,main.bib,newfile.tex"

Editing project file

After |:TProjectEdit| screen will be split and you can make corrections,
comments or add new files to project (or remove them). To make changes
available to Vim issue command |:TProjectWrite|. This will save file and
source it immediately (simple ":write" don't change values of variables).

CUSTOM MACROS                           *latex-custom-macros* {{{

This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite.Macros menu.

This module provides a way of inserting customized macros into the current
file.

When latex-suite starts up, it scans the latex-suite/macros/ directory and
creates a menu from the files found there. Each file is considered as a single
macro. You can place your own macros in this directory, using |placeholders|
if wanted.

When you choose a macro from the menu, the corresponding file is read into the
current buffer after the current cursor position. In non-gui mode, you can
use the |TMacro| command instead of choosing from the menu. This command
takes the macro file name as an argument. When called without arguments
(preferred usage), then a list of avaiable macro files is displayed and the
user is prompted to choose one of them).

There are some other tools provided in this menu, namely:

{New}            Creates a new (unnamed) buffer in the latex-suite/macros/
                 directory.
                 Use the command :TexMacroNew in non-gui mode.

{Edit}           Opens up the corresponding macro file for editing.
                 Use :TexMacroEdit in non-gui mode.

{Delete}         Deletes the corresponding macro.
                 Use the prefixed numbers for fast navigation of menus.
                 Use :TexMacroDelete in non-gui mode.

{Redraw}         Rescans the macros/ directory and refreshes the macros list.

LATEX COMPILING                             *latex-compiling* {{{

This functionality is available via the TeX-Suite menu.

Latex-suite ships with a set of tools to compile LaTeX files into various
formats and view them.

If you are using commonly used LaTeX tools, then you should be all set as soon
as you download and install latex-suite.  In order to compile a LaTeX file,
simply press \ll while editing the file.  This runs latex on the current file
and displays the errors in a |quickfix-window|. You can then scroll through
the errors and press <enter> to be taken to the location of the corresponding
error. Along with the errors being listed in the quickfix window, the
corresponding log file is also opened in |preview| mode. It is scrolled
automatically to keep in sync with the error being viewed in the quickfix
window.

|latex-compiler-target|         : specifying a different target format for
                                  compilation.
|latex-suite-compiler|          : specifying a diffrent compiler.
|latex-master-file|             : specifying a different file for compilation
                                  instead of file being edited.
|latex-compiler-customization|  : customizing the output of the
                                  latex-compiler.
|latex-part-compiling|          : compiling only a part of a file.

                                                     *latex-compiler-target*
In order to effectively use latex-suite to compile and view formats other than
DVI, you will need to edit the |texrc| file and set the variables:
>
    g:Tex_CompileRule_<format>
    g:Tex_ViewRule_<format>

where <format> is a string like "pdf", "dvi" etc. These variables define
``rules'' for compiling and viewing the corresponding target.

Example: In texrc, the compilation rule for dvi is by default: >
    g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex --interaction=nonstopmode $*'

Default values are also provided for ps and pdf formats. You might want to
change these rules in texrc according to your local tex environment.

Once a ``rule'' has been set up for a format, you can set the target format by
using the {TeX-Suite.Target Format} menu item. Alternatively, you can use the
|:TTarget| command. You can also set the viewer and compiler to different
formats, by using the menu items or using the commands |:TCTarget| and
|:TVTarget|.

NOTE: If you try choosing a format for which a rule is not defined, you
will get a short warning message and no action will be taken.

NOTE: Specifying a different format does not automatically account for
dependencies. For example, if in your case you do:
    .tex -> .dvi -> .ps -> .pdf
then you will need to choose dvi first, compile, change format to ps, compile,
change format and so on.

                                                    *latex-suite-compiler*
The simplest way to choose a different compiler is to edit the >
    g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi
variable.

If however, you are only using the compiler/tex.vim module from latex-suite,
there are a couple of other ways to change things.

Just as in the case of the standard tex compiler, ``if b:tex_flavor or
g:tex_flavor (in this precedence) variable exists, it defines TeX flavor for
:make (actually, this is the name of executed command), and if both variables
do not exist, it defaults to "latex"'' (from |compiler-tex|)

NOTE: For win32 users user MikTeX, sometimes the latex compiler's output has a
bug where a single number is split across different lines. In this case, put
the included vim-latex somewhere in your $PATH, make it executable and point
g:tex_flavor to it. This is not always necessary, and you might want to try it
without vim-latexSuite till you first notice any problem.

                                                        *latex-master-file*
Often times the file you are currently editing is only a fragment being
\input'ed into a master tex file. In such cases you will need to do create a
dummy file in the directory containing the current file. This dummy file is of
the form:
>
    <mailfilename>.latexmain

In other words, if the current file is ~/thesis/chapter.tex, where
chapter.tex is being \input'ed into ~/thesis/main.tex, then create a file
called >
    main.tex.latexmain
<
in the ~/thesis directory. This will then run "latex main.tex"
NOTE: Here main.tex.latexmain is a different file from main.tex itself.
main.tex need not be renamed. The contents of main.tex.latexmain are not used.
This ofcourse restricts each directory to have a single master file.

                                               *latex-compiler-customization*
Latex-suite ships with a modified (enhanced ?) version of the standard tex
compiler plugin maintained by Artem Chuprina. The modifications allow this
version to be customizable. i.e the user can set a verbosity level for the
compiler.

By default it is set up in a "non-verbose", "ignore-common-warnings" mode,
which means that irrelevant lines from the compilers output will be
ignored and also some very common warnings are ignored.

Depending on the "ignore-level", (which can be set with the command TCLevel as
described below) the following kinds of messages are ignored.  An ignore level
of 3 for instance means that messages of type 1-3 will be ignored. By default,
the ignore level is set to 4. (You can change this by setting
g:Tex_IgnoreLevel in your .vimrc).

1. LaTeX Warning: Underfull box ...
2. LaTeX Warning: Overfull box ...
   both these warnings (very common) are due to \hbox settings not being
   satisfied nicely.
3. LaTeX Warning: Specifier 'h' changed to 't'.
   This errors occurs when TeX is not able to correctly place a floating
   object at a specified location, because of which it defaulted to the
   top of the page.
4. LaTeX Warning: You have requested ...,
   This warning occurs in slitex when using the xypic package.
5. Missing number error:
   Usually, when the name of an included eps file is spelled incorrectly,
   then the \bb-error message is accompanied by a bunch of "missing
   number, treated as zero" error messages. This level ignores these
   warnings.
   NOTE: number 5 is actually a LaTeX error, not a warning!

Use >

    TCLevel <level>

where level is a number to set the ignore level dynamically. This will re-do
the 'efm' so that next time you do \ll, you will not be shown those kinds of
warnings. Use "TCLevel 0" to ignore no warnings at all, but still remain in a
"non-verbose", i.e ignore unmatched lines mode.

When TCLevel is called with the unquoted string strict as >

    TClevel strict

then the 'efm' switches to a "verbose", "no-lines-ignored" mode which is
useful when you want to make final checks of your document and want to be
careful not to let things slip by.

You can also choose to ignore other kinds of patterns by setting
g:IgnoreWarnings in your ~/.vimrc. This is a '¡' seperated list of commands.
Its default value is: >
	let g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings =
		\'Underfull¡'.
		\'Overfull¡'.
		\'specifier changed to¡'.
		\'You have requested¡'.
		\'Missing number, treated as zero.'
<
                                              *latex-part-compiling*
You can compile only fragment of document. This can be useful while working on
one sophisticated equation or one chapter.

Mark fragment in Visual mode and press <F10> (or choose this option from
TeX-Suite menu). This fragment will be saved to temporary file with preamble
and compiled to current target. View new created document with \ls shortcut or
TeX-Suite menu element. Two ":" commands are also available: very interesting
|TPartComp| and |TPartView|.

===========================================================================
LATEX VIEWING AND SEARCHING                   *latex-viewing* {{{

Latex-suite ships with a set of functios for viewing .dvi files generated by
LaTeX. Press \lv while viewing a tex file. This will start the dvi viewer on
your system and display the current file in it. If the variable g:DviViewer
exists, then it is used as the program for viewing DVI files, otherwise it
defaults to yap for windows or xdvi for unix.
NOTE: These programs are called with some additional arguments. If you DVI
viewer doesnt accept these, then you will need to change the code itself. This
will be configurable by a variable in the future.

Like in the case of the compiler, you can specify the master file for the
current file (see |latex-master-file|)

                                                       *latex-searching*
Yap for windows, some versions of xdvi for windows and xdvi for unices provide
the ability to do "forward searching" on the .dvi file. This means that you
can have the DVI viewer jump to a specified location.

Pressing \ls while viewing a LaTeX file will perform this function, i.e the
viewer will jump to the location under the cursor.

NOTE: MikTeX and xdvi require that the dvi file be generated using the
--src-specials flag in order to enable forward/reverse searching. By default,
latex-suite will call LaTeX with this argument.

These functions were added after a tip from Dimitri Antoniou on vim.sf.net.
See >
   http://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip.php?tip_id=225
for a description on how to get xdvik/yap to play along with Vim.

===========================================================================
LATEX FOLDING                                 *latex-folding* {{{

Latex-suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a plugin for
creating "fake" syntax folds on the fly. The fold method is actually manual
but the folding is based on LaTeX syntax. This offers a speed increase over
regular syntax folding. Ofcourse it has the disadvantage that the folds are
not dynamic, i.e newly created syntax items are not automatically folded up.
(This is a compromise between speed and convinience).

When you open up a LaTeX file, all the portions will be automatically folded
up. However, no new folds will be created until you press <F6> or \rf. (rf
stands for "refresh folds").

The fold-text is set to the first line of the folded text unless the fold is a
table, figure etc. (an environment). In this case, if a \caption and/or a
label is found in the folded region, then those are used to make a more
meaningful fold-tex, otherwise the second line of the environment is displayed
along with the name of the environment. In other words, the following >

    \begin{figure}[h]
      \centerline{\psfig{figure=slidercrank.eps,height=6cm}}
      \caption{The Slider Crank Mechanism.}
      \label{fig:slidercrank}

PACKAGE HANDLING                             *latex-packages* {{{
                                        *latex-menu-packages*

This functionality is avaiable via the Tex-Packages menu.

                                                 *latex-package-scanning*
This module provides ways of customizing the menus based on which packages
are being used in the current LaTeX file. When latex-suite first starts up, it
scans the |latex-master-file| for >
    \usepackage{name}
lines and if the corresponding package is found in the latex-suite/packages/
directory, then creates a sub-menu based on the specification found in that
file.
Often preamble is too long and you can put whole stuff into your own package
and place it somewhere. Most obvious place is directory of edited file. But
LaTeX looks for this such packages in places pointed in $TEXINPUTS environment
variable. You can copy this variable to your texrc file in g:Tex_TEXINPUTS
variable. Example: >
    TexLet g:Tex_TEXINPUTS = '.:~/texmf//:'
Short explanation. '.' means looking in current directory, '~/texmf//' in
~/texmf directory and its all subdirectories. Last ':' means looking in normal
TeX directories. Alas, Vim cannot (yet :) look in all subdirectories. Thus it
find only '~/texmf/mypack.sty' and '~/texmf/sty/mypack.sty' but not
'~texmf/tex/sty/mypack.sty'.

                                                  *latex-package-dictionary*
Furthermore, if a file with the same name is found in the
latex-suite/dictionaries/ directory, then that file will be added to Vim's
'dictionary' setting for use with the |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-K| command.  Package
dictionary file should follow outlines specified in 'dictionary'.


                                                        *latex-package-file*
A latex-package-file is a simple Vim script which defines some global
variables. These global variables are used by latex-suite to create the custom
menu. See the |latex-package-file-writing| section how to define a customized
package file.

If you do make a package file for latex-suite, please consider contacting the
|latex-suite-maintainer|.

Example:

From the packages menu, choose the >
    Tex-Packages.Supported.SIunits
option. This will insert a line of form: >
    \usepackage[<++>]<++>{SIunits}<++>
at the beginning of the file (with the cursor placed at the first
|placeholder|. You will also notice that the packages menu now contains a
sub-menu called SIunits, which contains the commands and options for the
SIunits package.You can use this sub-menu to insert commands from the package,
add options to the package etc.

NOTE: Since the package file is a Vim script, you could define custom
functions there, add mappings etc.

You can perform the following actions via the packages menu:

{Update}           This command is to be invoked with the cursor placed on the
                   package name. If the corresponding package is found, then a
                   sub-menu with the supported commands, options is created.
                   A |latex-package-dictionary| might also be created.

{UpdateAll}        This function reads the preamble of the document for
                   \usepackage lines and if latexSuite supports the detected
                   packages, then sub-menus containing the package options and
                   commands is created.
                   A |latex-package-dictionary| might also be created.

{Supported}        This sub-menu contains a list of all the package files stored in
                   latex-suite/packages directory. When you choose one of
                   these, a \usepackage{package_name} line will inserted in
                   the preamble of the |latex-master-file| and a sub-menu for
                   the package will be created.
                   If options are detected, then the inserted line is of the
                   form:
                        \usepackage[<++>]{package_name}
                   A |latex-package-dictionary| might also be created.

                                               *latex-package-file-writing*
Writing package files is very easy and gives possibility of creating simple
templates with prefixes to command. Package file have to contain two
variables:
g:TeX_package_option_<package> and g:TeX_package_<package>

First contain package options, second various commands supplied with
<package>.

Package option variable: >
    g:TeX_package_option_<package> = "Option,Option2="
= at the end gives: >
    Option2=x,<++>
Here is allowed one prefix:
{sbr:option} Breaks option menu into submenu. {option} is the name of submenu.

Package variable: >
    g:TeX_package_<package> = "pre:Command,pre:Command1"
More detailed example is in latex-suite/packages/exmpl file (slightly
outdated).
Here is short summary of prefixes which can be used in package files:
(x - place with cursor, <++> - |placeholder|)

{env:command}  Environment: creates simple environment template >
            \begin{command}
                x
            \end{command}<++>
{eno:command}  Environment with option: >
            \begin[x]{command}
                <++>
            \end{command}<++>
{ens:command[<<option>>]...}  Environment special: >
            \begin[<<option>>]...{command}
                <++>
            \end{command}<++>
{bra:command} Brackets: >
            \command{x}<++>
{brd:command} Brackets double: >
            \command{x}{<++>}<++>
{brs:command[<<option>>]...} Brackets special (as environment special: >
            \command[<+x+>]{<++>}{<++>}<++>
{nor:command} Normal: >
            \command<Space>
{noo:command} Normal with option: >
            \command[x]<++>
{nob:command} Normal with option and brackets: >
            \command[x]{<++>}<++>
{pla:command} Plain: >
            command<Space>
{spe:command} Special: >
            command   <-literal insertion of command
{sep:command} creates separator. Good for aesthetics and usability :)
{sbr:command} Breaks menu into submenus. <command> will be title of submenu.
            Can be used also in package variable.

Command can be also given without prefix:. The result is >
           \command

LATEX SUITE COMMANDS                   *latex-suite-commands* {{{

LatexSuite defines set of commands for non-GUI and power users. They are
taking care about Macros, Templates and Packages.

:TMacro [{macro}]                      *:TMacro*
                When used without any arguments lists all available macros
                defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompts you to
                choose one of them.
                With one argument |:read| this macro under cursor position.
                With more than one argument it will not work :)

:TMacroEdit [{macro}]                  *:TMacroEdit*
                Splits window for editing {macro}.
                When used without any arguments lists all available macros
                defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompt you to
                choose one of them.

:TMacroNew                             *:TMacroNew*
                Splits window to write new macro. Directory in new buffer is
                locally changed to latex-suite/macros/.

:TMacroDelete [{macro}]                *:TMacroDelete*
                Delets {macro} from latex-suite/macros/ directory.
                When used without any arguments lists all available macros
                defined in latex-suite/macros/ directory and prompt you to
                choose one of them.

:TPackage [{package} [{package} ...]]  *:TPackage*
                When used without any arguments lists name of the packages for
                which support is available. Report depends if you are using
                GUI version and/or g:Tex_Menus is set to 1 or not. When you
                are not using menus command lists files from
                latex-suite/dictionaries/ (this is main support for non-menus
                version of latexSuite) if menus are on |TPackage| lists
                files from latex-suite/packages/ directory.

                When {package} is given command turns on all possible support
                for this {package} (|latex-menu-packages|,
                |latex-packages-dictionary|). Number of arguments separated
                with spaces is limited only with common sense.

:TPackageUpdate                        *:TPackageUpdate*
                This command `reads' name of package under cursor and turns on
                possible support.

:TPackageUpdateAll                     *:TPackageUpdateAll*
                After issuing this command latexSuite scans the file in
                looking for not declared packages, removing not needed entries
                from Packages menu and turning off not necessary packages'
                dictionaries.

:TTemplate [{template}]                *:TTemplate*
                When used without any arguments lists all available templates
                from latex-suite/templates/ directory and prompts to choose
                one of them.
                With one argument :0|read| {template} file.
                With more than one argument it will not work :)

:TSection [{argument}]                 *:TSection*
                Used without any arguments inserts last section type
                (|latex-sectioning|).
                Accepts arguments:
                <n>     inserts section name in <n> logical level.
                        Levels are:
                        0 part
                        1 chapter
                        2 section
                        3 subsection
                        4 subsubsection
                        5 paragraph
                        6 subparagraph

                +<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels above the last
                        used comand

                -<n>    inserts section name <n> logical levels below the last
                        used comand

                +       inserts section name one logical level below the last
                        used command (equal to +1).

                ++      inserts section name two logical levels below the last
                        used command (equal to +2).

                -       inserts section name one logical level over the last
                        used command (equal to -1).

                --      inserts section name two logical levels over the last
                        used command (equal to -2).

                Command accepts also latexSuite mappings (|latex-macros|)
                without preceding S and in lowercase: >
                        :TSection pa
<               will result in \part{}. It is possible to use full names of
                sections: >
                        :TSection part
<
:TSectionAdvanced                      *:TSectionAdvanced*
                Accepts the same arguments as |TSection| but leads to a couple
                of questions (whether you want to include the section in the
                table of contents, whether there is a shorter name for the
                table of contents) and then creates a more intelligent
                template.

:TLook                                 *:TLook*
                Accepts one argument. Will look through .tex files in
                directory of edited file for argument. It can be regexp. You
                don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr> takes you to
                location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.
                Note: TLook uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'. Its
                regular expressions can be different from those of Vim.

:TLookBib                              *:TLookBib*
                Accepts one argument. Will look through .bib files in
                directory of edited file for argument. It can be regexp. You
                don't have to enclose argument in "". <cr> takes you to
                location. Other keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.
                Note: TLookBib uses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'.  Its
                regular expressions can be different from those of Vim.

:TLookAll                              *:TLookAll*
                Accepts one argument. Will look through all files in directory
                of edited file for argument. It can be regexp. You don't have
                to enclose argument in "". <cr> takes you to location. Other
                keys work as described in |latex-viewer|.
                Note: TLookuses :grep command and is using 'grepprg'.  Its
                regular expressions can be different from those of Vim.

:TPartComp                             *:TPartComp*
                No argument allowed but accepts range in all formats. Define
                fragment of interest with :'a,'b, :/a/,/b/, :'<,'> or :20,30.
                All other rules of compilation apply.

:TPartView                             *:TPartView*
                Show last compiled fragment. All rules of viewing apply but
                |latex-searching|.

:Tshortcuts [{arg}]                    *:Tshortcuts*
                Show shortcuts in terminal (not using menu). Without {arg}
                you will see simple menu prompting for one of them. Possible
                arguments:
                g       General shortcuts
                e       Environment shortcuts
                f       Font shortcuts
                s       Section shortcuts
                a       All shortcuts

And finally, the credits:

Lubomir Host      : provided the diacritics and also helped in development.
Alexander Wagner  : valuable suggestions during development.
Luc Hermitte      : his variation of Stephen Riehm's bracketing system is used
                    in latex-suite.
Gergely Kontra    : the clever little JumpFunc() in imaps.vim is due to him.
                    The implementation of the templates also borrows from
                    mu-template.vim by him.
Dimitri Antoniou  : author of ltags and also provided the nice tip about
                    forward / reverse search on DVI documents.
Stephen Riehm     : the extremely helpful bracketing system is from him.
Alan Schmitt      : provided some macros/folding elements.
Hari Krishna Dara : for ExecMap(), the clever little function which makes
                    typing visual mode mappings so much easier and error-free.
Alan G Isac       : for the comprehensive BibT() function for entering bibtex
                    entries.
Gontran Baerts    : for libList.vim
Peter Heslin      : useful discussion and also a lot of bug fixes.
                    the %%fakesection in folding.vim.

A large number of functions in latex-suite come from various other people.
Some of those people might have been missed here. Each function should however
have the author's name/e-mail above it. Thats the more authoritative place to
check out who has done what.
