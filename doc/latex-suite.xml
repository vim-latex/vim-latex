    Latex-Suite attempts to provide a comprehensive set of tools to
    view, edit and compile LaTeX documents in Vim. Together, they
    provide tools starting from macros to speed up editing LaTeX
    documents to functions for forward searching .dvi documents.
    Latex-suite has been possible because of the contributions of many
    people. Please see <link
     linkend="latex-suite-credits">latex-suite-credits</link> for a list of
    people who have helped.

   If you are reading this, it most probably means that you have already

   Make sure that you create a few necessary settings in your
   <literal>~/.vimrc.</literal>

" IMPORTANT: win32 users will need to have 'shellslash' set so that latex

 <section id="latex-suite-templates">
  <title>Inserting Templates</title>
  <para>
   This functionality is available via the <literal>TeX-Suite &gt;
    Templates</literal> menu.
   This module provides a way to insert custom templates at the beginning of the
   current file.
  </para>
  <para>
   When latex-suite first starts up, it scans the
   <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/</literal>
   directory and creates menu items based on the files found there. When
   you select a template from this menu, the file will be read in above
   the first line of the current file.
  </para>
  <para>
   A template file can utlilize placeholders for initializing the cursor
   position when the template is read in and subsequent movement. In
   addition, template files can contain dynamic elements such as the
   time of creation of a file etc, by using vim expressions.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can place your own templates in the
   <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/templates/</literal> directory in
   order for them to be available via the menu. Unless &ls; releases a
   template with the same name, these files should not get over-written
   when you install a new release over an existing one.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    Templates are also accessible for non-gui users with the command
    |<literal>:TTemplate</literal>|. The argument should be name of
    the corresponding template file.  If the command is called
    without arguments (preferred usage), then a list of available
    templates is displayed and the user is asked to choose one of
    them.
   </para>

 <section id="latex-macros">
  <title>&ls; Macros</title>
  <para>
   Latex-Suite ships with a very comprehensive set of insert mode and
   |visual-mode| mappings and menu items to typeset most of the LaTeX
   elements.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    These mappings are are not standard mappings in the sense that
    only the last character is mapped. See plugin/imaps.vim for
    further documentation. For example, in the case of the mapping
    <literal>EFI</literal> provided by &ls; you can press the characters
    '<literal>E</literal>', '<literal>F</literal>' and '<literal>I</literal>'
    as slowly as you wish (unlike the normal <literal>imap</literal> command
    where <literal>timeout</literal> issues are involved). The characters are
    visible as you type them (unlike normal <literal>imap</literal>s) and you
    can use the movement or backspace key to correct yourself unlike normal
    mappings.
   </para>
  </note>
  <anchor id="place-holder" />
  <note id="place-holders">
   <title>Place Holders</title>
   <para>
    Almost all macros provided in &ls; implement Stephen Riem's bracketing
    system and Gergely Kontra's <literal>JumpFunc()</literal> for handling
    place-holders. This consists of using "place-holders" to mark off
    locations where the next relevant editing has to be done. As an example,
    when you type <literal>EFI</literal> in |insert-mode|, you will get the
    following:
    <programlisting>\begin{figure}[h]
    \centerline{\psfig{figure=&lt;+eps file+&gt;}}
    \caption{&lt;+caption text+&gt;}
    \label{fig:&lt;+label+&gt;}
\end{figure}&lt;++&gt;</programlisting>
    The text <literal>&lt;+eps file+&gt;</literal> will be selected and
    you will be left in |select-mode| so that you can continue typing
    straight away. After having typed in the file name, you can press
    <literal>&lt;Ctrl-J&gt;</literal> (while still in insert-mode). This will
    take you directly to the next "place-holder". i.e, <literal>&lt;+caption
     text+&gt;</literal> will be visually selected with Vim in select mode
    again for typing in the caption. This saves on a lot of key presses.
   </para>
  </note>
  <note id="overriding-macros">
   <title>Over-riding &ls; Macros</title>
   <para>
    If you wish to change these macros from their default values, for
    example, if you wish to change <literal>`w</literal> to expand to
    <literal>\omega</literal> instead of its default expansion to
    <literal>\wedge</literal>, you should use the <literal>IMAP</literal>
    function as described in the <link linkend="ls-new-macros">Using 
     IMAP()</link> section.
   </para>
   <para>
    An important thing to note is that if you wish to over-ride macros
    created by &ls; rather than merely create new macros, you should place
    the <literal>IMAP()</literal> calls in a script which gets sourced
    after the files in &ls;. A good place typically is as a file-type
    plugin file in the
    <literal>~/.vim/after/ftplugin/</literal> directory. (Use
    <literal>~/vimfiles</literal> if you are using
    <literal>WINDOWS</literal>). For example to over-ride
    <literal>`w</literal> to <literal>\omega</literal> instead of
    <literal>\wedge</literal>, place the following line in (say)
    <literal>~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex_macros.vim</literal>:
    <programlisting>call IMAP('`w', '\omega', 'tex')</programlisting>
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     It is important to use a file-name which will get sourced on a
     <literal>FileType</literal> event. Therefore you must use a file-name
     which conforms to the standards as described in
     <literal>|ftplugin-name|</literal>.
    </para>
   </note>
  </note>
  <para>
   The following sections describe the various editing macros provided
   by &ls;.
  </para>
  <section id="environment-mappings">
   <title>Environment Mappings</title>
   &ls; provides a rich set of mappings to insert, enclose and modify
   &latex; environments.
   <section id="insert-mode-environment-mappings">
    <title id="insert-mode-environment-mappings.title">Insert-mode Mappings</title>
    <para> 
     These mappings insert LaTeX "environments" such as:
     <programlisting>\begin{center}
    &ph;
\end{center}&ph;</programlisting>
     with the cursor left at the first |placeholder|. There are
     various ways of inserting environments into the source file. If
     the environment is a standard latex environment, then latex suite
     might also include common fields associated with it.
    </para>
    <para>
     See <link linkend="Tex_Env_name">this section</link> for details on
     how to customize the way &ls; will expand various environments.
    </para>
    <section id="ls-imap-f5">
     <title>Method 1</title>
     <para>
      If you press <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> in the
      insert mode while on an empty line, latex-suite prompts you
      with a list of environments you might want to insert. You can
      either choose one from the list or type in a new environment
      name. This list can be customized via the <link
       linkend="Tex_PromptedEnvironments"><literal>g:Tex_PromptedEnvironments</literal></link>
      setting.
     </para>
     <para>
      In addition to the <literal>Tex_PromptedEnvironments</literal>
      variable, &ls; also lists envionments found in custom packages as
      described in the section <link linkend="package-actions">Package
       actions.</link>
     </para>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Method 2</title>
     <para>
      If you press <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> while on a line
      containing a single word, then latex-suite creates a
      environment of that name.
     </para>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Method 3</title>
     <para>
      The shifted function keys, <literal>&lt;S-F1&gt;</literal> to
      <literal>&lt;S-F4&gt;</literal> can also be optionally mapped
      to some common environments which you insert most often. The
      environments mapped to each key can also be customized via the <link
       linkend="Tex_HotKeyMappings">g:Tex_HotKeyMappings</link> setting.
     </para>
    </section>
    <section>
     <title>Method 4</title>
     <para>
      Environments can also be inserted by pressing a 3 capital
      letter sequence starting with an <literal>E</literal>. The following subsection
      describes this in detail. The sequence of 3 letters generally
      tries to follow the following rules:
     </para>
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
       All environment mappings begin with <literal>E</literal>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       If the environment can be broken up into 2 distinct words,
       such as flushright (flush + right), then the next 2 letters
       are the first letters of the 2 words.  Example:
       <programlisting>flushleft  (_f_lush + _l_eft)  ---&gt; EFL
flushright (_f_lush + _r_ight) ---&gt; EFR
eqnarray   (_e_qn + _a_rray)   ---&gt; EEA</programlisting>
       If on the other hand, the environment name cannot be broken
       up into 2 distinct words, then the next 2 letters are the
       first 2 letters of the name of the environment.
       Example:
       <programlisting>equation (_eq_uation)          ---&gt; EEQ</programlisting>
      </listitem>
     </orderedlist>
     <para>
      Unfortunately there are some environments that cannot be
      split in two words and first two letters in name are
      identical. In this case shortcut is created from E, first and
      last letter.  Example:
      <programlisting>quote     (_q_uot_e_)          ---&gt; EQE
quotation (_q_uotatio_n_)      ---&gt; EQN</programlisting>
      Of course, not every last one of the environments can follow
      this rule because of ambiguities. In case of doubt, pull down
      the Tex-Environments menu. The menu item should give the hint
      for the map.
     </para>
    </section>
   </section>
   <section id="visual-mode-environment-mapings">
    <title>Visual-mode Mappings</title>
    <para>
     &ls; provides visual-mode mappings which enclose visually
     selected portions of text in environments. These mappings are
     derived from the corresponding insert-mode environment mappings
     according to the following simple rule:

     <programlisting>ECE           --&gt; ,ce</programlisting>
     The rule simply says that the leading <literal>E</literal> is
     converted to <literal>,</literal> and the next 2 letters are
     small case.  

     Here <literal>ECE</literal> is the insert-mode map which inserts
     the <literal>\begin{center} ... \end{center}</literal>
     environment.  Correspondingly, if you select a portion of text
     visually and press <literal>,ce</literal> while still in visual
     mode, then the selected portion will be enclosed in
     <literal>\begin{center} ... \end{center}</literal>.

     Some of the visual mode mappings are sensitive to whether you
     choose line-wise or character-wise. For example, if you choose a
     word and press <literal>,ce</literal>, then you get
     <literal>\centerline{word}</literal>, whereas if you press
     <literal>,ce</literal> on a line-wise selection, you get:
     <programlisting>\begin{center}
    line
\end{center}</programlisting>
    </para>
    <anchor id="ls-vmap-f5" />
    <para>
     You can also select a portion of text visually and press
     <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> while still in visual mode. This will
     prompt you with a list of environments. (This list can be customized
     via the <link
      linkend="Tex_PromptedEnvironments">g:Tex_PromptedEnvironments</link>
     setting). You can either choose from this list or type in a new
     environment name. Once the selection is done, &ls; encloses the
     visually selected portion in the chosen environment.
    </para>
   </section>
   <section id="normal-mode-environment-mappings">
    <title>Normal Mode Mappings</title>
    <para>
     Pressing <literal>&lt;S-F5&gt;</literal> in normal mode detects which
     environment the cursor is presently located in and prompts you to
     replace it with a new one. The innermost environment is detected. For
     example, in the following source:
     <programlisting>\begin{eqnarray}
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4
  \end{array}
\end{eqnarray}</programlisting>
     if you are located in the middle "2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4" line, then pressing
     <literal>&lt;S-F5&gt;</literal> will prompt you to change the array
     environment, not the eqnarray environment. In addition, &ls; will also
     try to change lines within the environment to be consistent with the
     new environment. For example, if the original environment was an
     <literal>eqnarray</literal> environment with a
     <literal>\label</literal> command, then changing it to an
     <literal>eqnarray*</literal> environment will delete the
     <literal>\label</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Pressing <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> in normal mode has the same
     effect as pressing <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> in insert-mode,
     namely you will be prompted to choose an environment to insert.
    </para>
   </section>
  </section>
  <section id="latex-command-maps">
   <title>&latex; command maps</title>
   <anchor id="ls-imap-f7" />
   <anchor id="ls-imap-s-f7" />
   <para>
    &ls; provides two simple mappings <literal>&lt;F7&gt;</literal> and
    <literal>&lt;S-F7&gt;</literal> which work in both insert and normal
    mode in an idential manner. In insert mode, if the cursor is located on
    (or just after) a non-whitespace character, then a command from the
    last word (<literal>&lt;cword&gt;</literal>) is created. If the cursor
    is located on a white-space character, then you will be prompted with a
    list of commands to choose from. The list of commands is constructed
    from the <link
     linkend="Tex_PromptedCommands"><literal>g:Tex_PromptedCommands</literal></link>
    setting and also from commands which &ls; finds while scanning custom
    packages which &ls; finds. See the <link
     linkend="package-actions">Package actions</link> section for details
    on which files are scanned etc.
   </para>
   <para>
    For certain common commands, &ls; will expand them to include
    additional arguments as needed. Otherwise, it will simply change the
    word under the cursor as follows
    <programlisting>word --> \word{&ph;}&ph;</programlisting>
    You can define custom expansios of commands using the
    <literal>Tex_Com_{name}</literal> setting as described in <link
     linkend="Tex_Com_name">here</link>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In both insert and normal mode <literal>&lt;S-F7&gt;</literal> will
    find out if you are presently within an environment and then prompt you
    with a list of commands to change it to.
   </para>
   <anchor id="ls-vmap-f7" />
   <para>
    You can also select a portion of text visually and press
    <literal>&lt;F7&gt;</literal> while still in visual mode. This will
    prompt you with a list of commands. (This list can be customized
    via the <link
     linkend="Tex_PromptedCommands">g:Tex_PromptedCommands</link>
    setting). You can either choose from this list or type in a new
    command name. Once the selection is done, &ls; encloses the
    visually selected portion in the chosen command.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="font-maps">
   <title>Font Mappings</title> 
   <para>
    These mappings insert font descriptions such as:
    <literal>\textsf{&ph;}&ph;</literal>
    with the cursor left in place of the first <link
     linkend="place-holders">placeholder</link> (the &ph; characters).
   </para>
   <para>
    Mnemonic:
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>first letter is always F (F for font)</listitem>
     <listitem>next 2 letters are the 2 letters describing the font.</listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </para>
   <para>
    Example: Typing <literal>FEM</literal> in insert-mode expands to
    <literal>\emph{&ph;}&ph;</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Just like environment mappings, you can visually select an area and press
    <literal>`sf</literal> to have it enclosed in:
    <literal>\textsf{word}</literal>
    or
    <programlisting>{\sffamily
line
}</programlisting>
    depending on character-wise or line-wise selection.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="section-mappings">
   <title>Section Mappings</title> 
   <para>
    These maps insert &latex; sections such as:
    <programlisting>\section{&ph;}&ph;</programlisting>
    etc. Just as in the case of environments and fonts, can be enclosed with a
    visual selection. The enclosing is not sensetive to character or line-wise
    selection.
   </para>
   <para>
    Mnemonic: (make your own!)
    <programlisting>SPA for part
SCH for chapter
SSE for section
SSS for subsection
SS2 for subsubsection
SPG for paragraph
SSP for subparagraph</programlisting>

    Example:
    SSE in insert mode inserts
    <programlisting>\section{&lt;++&gt;}&lt;++&gt;</programlisting>
    If you select a word or line and press <literal>,se</literal>, then you
    get
    <programlisting>\section{section name}</programlisting>
    The menu item in Tex-Environments.Sections have a sub-menu called
    'Advanced'. Choosing an item from this sub-menu asks a couple of questions
    (whether you want to include the section in the table of contents, whether
    there is a shorter name for the table of contents) and then creates a more

    <literal>BBH</literal> and <literal>BBX</literal> are provided, all of
    which essentially act in the same manner. When you type any of these in

    for the bibliographic entry.

    When latex-suite starts up, it scans the

    When you choose a macro from the menu, the corresponding file is read

    mode, you can use the |TMacro| command instead of choosing from the

   <title>Making your own Macros via <literal>IMAP()</literal></title>
   <para>
    If you find the need to create your own macros, then you can use the
    <literal>IMAP()</literal> function provided with &ls;. See <link
     linkend="why-IMAP" endterm="why-IMAP.title"></link> for a short
    explanation of why you might prefer <literal>IMAP()</literal> over
    &vim;'s standard <literal>:imap</literal> command. An example best
    explains the usage:
    <programlisting>:call IMAP('NOM', '\nomenclature{&ph;}&ph;', 'tex')</programlisting>
    This will create a &ls;-style mapping, where if you type
    <literal>NOM</literal> in insert mode, you will get
    <literal>\nomenclature{&ph;}&ph;</literal> with the cursor left in
    place of the first <literal>&ph;</literal> characters. See <link
     linkend="ls-imaps-syntax" endterm="ls-imaps-syntax.title"></link> for
    a detailed explanation of the <literal>IMAP()</literal> command.
   </para>
   <para>
    For maps which are triggered for a given filetype, the
    <literal>IMAP()</literal> command above should be put in the filetype
    plugin script for that file. For example, for tex-specific mappings,
    the <literal>IMAP()</literal> calls should go in
    <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim</literal>. For globally visible maps,
    you will need to use the following in either your
    <literal>~/.vimrc</literal> or a file in your
    <literal>$VIM/plugin</literal> directory.
    <programlisting>augroup MyIMAPs

   <section id="why-IMAP">
    <title id="why-IMAP.title">Why use <literal>IMAP()</literal></title>
    <para>
     Using <literal>IMAP</literal> instead of &vim;'s built-in
     <literal>:imap</literal> command has a couple of advantages:
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
       The 'ttimeout' option will generally limit how easily you can type
       the left hand side for a normal <literal>:imap</literal>. if you type
       the left hand side too slowly, then the mapping will not be
       activated.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       If you mistype one of the letters of the lhs, then the mapping is
       deactivated as soon as you backspace to correct the mistake.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       The characters in lhs are shown on top of each other. This is fairly
       distracting. This becomes a real annoyance when a lot of characters
       initiate mappings.

         <entry>
          <para>
           This is the "left-hand-side" of the mapping. When you use
           <literal>IMAP</literal>, only the last character of this word is
           actually mapped, although the effect is that the whole word is
           mapped.
          </para>
          <para>
           If you have two mappings which end in a common
           <literal>lhs</literal>, then the mapping with the longer
           <literal>lhs</literal> is used. For example, if you do
           <programlisting>call IMAP('BarFoo', 'something', 'tex')
call IMAP('Foo', 'something else', 'tex')</programlisting>
            Then typing <literal>BarFoo</literal> inserts
            <literal>"something"</literal>, whereas <literal>Foo</literal> by
            itself inserts <literal>"something else"</literal>.
          </para>
          <para>
           Also, the nature of <literal>IMAP()</literal> makes creating
           certain combination of mappings impossible. For example if you
           have
           <programlisting>call IMAP('foo', 'something', 'tex')
call IMAP('foobar', 'something else', 'tex')</programlisting>
           Then you will never be able to trigger <literal>"foobar"</literal>
           because typing <literal>"foo"</literal> will immediately insert
           <literal>"something"</literal>. This is the "cost" which you incur
           over the normal <literal>:imap</literal> command for the
           convinience of no 'timeout' problems, the ability to correct
           <literal>lhs</literal> etc.

          <para>
           This string can also contain special characters such as
           <literal>&lt;enter&gt;</literal> etc. To do this, you will need
           to specify the second argument in double-quotes as follows:
           <programlisting>:call IMAP('EFE', "\\begin{figure}\&lt;CR&gt;&ph;\\end{figure}&ph;", 'tex')</programlisting>
           With this, typing <literal>EFE</literal> is equivalent to typing
           in the right-hand side with all the special characters in
           insert-mode. This has the advantage that if you have filetype
           indentation set up, then the right hand side will also be
           indented just as if you had typed it in normally.
          </para>
          <anchor id="IMAP_PutTextWithMovement" />
          <para>
           You can also set up a &ls; style mapping which calls a custom function
           as follows:
           <programlisting>:call IMAP('FOO', "\&lt;C-r&gt;=MyFoonction()\&lt;CR&gt;", 'tex')</programlisting>
           where <literal>MyFoonction</literal> is a custom function you have
           written. If <literal>MyFoonction</literal> also has to return a string
           containing <literal>&ph;</literal> characters, then you will need to
           use the function <literal>IMAP_PutTextWithMovement()</literal>. An
           example best explains the usage:
          </para>
          <programlisting>call IMAP('FOO', "\&lt;C-r&gt;=AskVimFunc()\&lt;CR&gt;", 'vim')

  <para>
   &ls; has a lot of functionality written to ease working with packages.
   Packages here refers to files which you include into the &latex;
   document using the <literal>\usepackage</literal> command.
  </para>
  <section id="inserting-packages">
   <title>Inserting package commands</title>
   <para>
    When you first invoke &ls;, it scans the
    <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages</literal> directory for
    package script files and creates a menu from all the files found there.
    This menu is created under <literal>TeX-Suite > Packages >
     Supported</literal>. This menu contains a list of packages "supported"
    by &ls;. When you choose one of the packages from this menu (for example
    the <literal>amsmath</literal> package), then a line of
    the form
    <programlisting>\usepackage[&ph;]{amsmath}&ph;</programlisting>
    will be inserted into the current file.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <literal>\usepackage</literal> line can also be inserted in an easy
    manner in the current file by pressing <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal>
    while in the preamble of the current document. This will set up a prompt
    from the supported packages and ask you to choose from one of them. If
    you do not find the package you want to insert in the list, you can type
    in a package-name and it will use that. Pressing
    <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> in the preamble on a line containing a
    single word will construct a <literal>\usepackage</literal> line from
    that word.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can also use the <link
     linkend="TPackage"><literal>TPackage</literal></link> to insert the
    <literal>\usepackage</literal> line.
   </para>
   <para>
    Once you have inserted a <literal>\usepackage</literal> line, for
    supported packages, you can use the Options and Commands menus
    described in the <link linkend="package-actions">next section</link>.

   </para>
   <para>
    where <literal>&lt;package&gt;</literal> is the package you just
    inserted (or was detected). You can use these menus to insert commands,
    environments and options which &ls; recognizes as belonging to this
    package.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     While inserting an option, you need to position yourself in the
     appropritate place in the document, most commonly inside the square
     braces in the <literal>\usepackage[]{packname}</literal> command. &ls;
     will not navigate to that location.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    In addition to creating these sub-meuns, &ls; will also scan the
    <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/dictionaries</literal> directory and
    if a dictionary file corresponding to the package file is found, then
    it will add the file to the <literal>'dict'</literal> setting in &vim;
    so you can use the <literal>&lt;C-X&gt;&lt;C-K&gt;</literal> command to
    complete words from that file.
   </para>

    For example, the <literal>SIUnits</literal> package has a custom
    dictionary.

    If a package detected at startup is found by &ls; in the current
    directory or in a location specified by the <link
     linkend="Tex_TEXINPUTS">g:Tex_TEXINPUTS</link> variable, &ls; will
    scan the package for <literal>\newenvironment</literal> and
    <literal>newcommand</literal> lines and also append any commands and
    environments found to the list of commands and environments which you
    are prompted with when you press <link

  <formalpara>
   <title>Update All</title>
   This function reads the preamble of the document for

    Whenever &ls; begins editing a new &latex; file, it scans it for

   <section id="custom-packages">
    <title>Custom Packages</title>
    <para>
     Often times, the preamble can become too long, and some people prefer
     to put most of their personalization in a custom package and include
     that using a <literal>\usepackage</literal> line. &ls; tries to search
     such customs package for other <literal>\usepackage</literal> lines, so
     that supported packages included in this indirect manner can also be
     used to create sub-menus, extend the <literal>'dict'</literal> setting
     etc. The most obvious place to place such custom packages is in the
     same directory as the edited file. In addition, &latex; also supports
     placing custom packages in places pointed to by the
     <literal>$TEXINPUTS</literal> environment variable.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you use the <literal>$TEXINPUTS</literal> variable in &latex;, and
     you wish &ls; to search these custom packages for
     <literal>\usepackage</literal> lines, then you need to initialize the
     <link linkend="Tex_TEXINPUTS"><literal>g:Tex_TEXINPUTS</literal></link>
     variable.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <literal>g:Tex_TEXINPUTS</literal> variable needs to be set in the
     same format which &vim; uses for the <literal>'path'</literal> setting.
     This format is explained in detail if you do 
     <programlisting>:help file-searching</programlisting>
     from within &vim;.
    </para>
    <para>
     Therefore the value of <literal>g:Tex_TEXINPUTS</literal> will most
     probably be different from <literal>$TEXINPUTS</literal> which your
     native &latex; distribution uses.
    </para>
    <para>
     Example:
     <programlisting>let g:Tex_TEXINPUTS = '~/texmf/mypackages/**,./**'</programlisting>
     The <literal>**</literal> indicates that all directories below the
     directory <literal>~/texmf/mypackages</literal> and
     <literal>./</literal> are to be scanned for custom packages.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      The present directory <literal>'.'</literal> is always searched. You

   <title>Writing supporting for a package</title>
   <para>
    Supporting a package is easy and consists of writing a vim script with
    the same name as the package and placing it in the
    <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/packages</literal> directory. A
    package script should define two variables as described in the next two
    sections. In addition to these two variables, you can also define any
    functions, environment definitions etc. in this file.
   </para>
   <section>
    <title><literal>g:Tex_package_option_&lt;package&gt;</literal></title>
    <para>
     This setting is a string containing a comma seperated list of options
     supported by this package.
    </para>
    <para>
     Example:
     <programlisting>g:Tex_pacakge_option_mypack = 'opt1,opt2=,sbr:group1,opt3,opt4'</programlisting>
     The <literal>=</literal> suffix means that the option takes a value.
     Use <literal>sbr:group name</literal> to seperate options into
     sub-menus. All successive options will be clubbed into the
     <literal>group1</literal> sub-menu till the next
     <literal>sbr:</literal> option is encountered.

More detailed example is in latex-suite/packages/exmpl file (slightly
outdated).
Here is short summary of prefixes which can be used in package files:
(x - place with cursor, &ph; - |placeholder|)

{env:command}  Environment: creates simple environment template
            \begin{command}
                x
            \end{command}&ph;
{eno:command}  Environment with option:
            \begin[x]{command}
                &ph;
            \end{command}&ph;
{ens:command[&lt;&lt;option&gt;&gt;]...}  Environment special:
            \begin[&lt;&lt;option&gt;&gt;]...{command}
                &ph;
            \end{command}&ph;
{bra:command} Brackets:
            \command{x}&ph;
{brd:command} Brackets double:
            \command{x}{&ph;}&ph;
{brs:command[&lt;&lt;option&gt;&gt;]...} Brackets special (as environment special:
            \command[&lt;+x+&gt;]{&ph;}{&ph;}&ph;
{nor:command} Normal:
            \command&lt;Space
{noo:command} Normal with option:
            \command[x]&ph;
{nob:command} Normal with option and brackets:
            \command[x]{&ph;}&ph;
{pla:command} Plain:
            command&lt;Space
{spe:command} Special:
            command   &lt;-literal insertion of command
{sep:command} creates separator. Good for aesthetics and usability :)
{sbr:command} Breaks menu into submenus. &lt;command&gt; will be title of submenu.
            Can be used also in package variable.

Command can be also given without prefix:. The result is
           \command

  <title>Latex Completion</title>
  <para>
   This module provides an easy way to insert references to labels and
   bibliographic entries. Although the completion capabilites are very
   diverse, &ls; only uses a single key (<literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> by
   default) to do all of it. Pressing the <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> key
   does different things based on where you are located. &ls; tries to
   guess what you might be trying to complete at the location where you
   pressed <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal>. For example, pressing
   <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> when you are within a
   <literal>\ref</literal> command will try to list the
   <literal>\label</literal>'s in the present directory. Pressing it when
   you are in a <literal>\cite</literal> command will list bibliography
   keys. &ls; also recognizes commands which need a file name argument and
   will put up an explorer window for you to choose a filename.
  </para>
  <note id="ls-set-grepprg">
   <title>Before you start with &ls;'s completion function...</title>
   <para>
    All of &ls;'s completion capabilities depend on a external program
    being available on your system which can search through a number of
    files for a reg-exp pattern. On *nix systems, the pre-installed
    <literal>grep</literal> utility is more than adequate.  Most windows
    systems come with a utility <literal>findstr</literal>, but that has
    proven to be very inadequate (for one, it does not have an option to
    force the file name to be displayed when searching through a single
    file). Your best bet is to install <ulink
     url="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</ulink>, but if you think thats
    overkill, you can <ulink
     url="http://www.google.com/search?q=windows%20gnu%20grep">search
     for</ulink> a windows implementation of GNU grep. (&ls; testing on
    windows has been done with cygwin's port of GNU grep).
   </para>
   <para>
    Once you have a <literal>grep</literal> program installed, you need to
    set the <literal>'grepprg'</literal> option for vim. Make sure you use a
    setting which forces the program to display file names even when you are
    searching through a single file. For GNU grep, the syntax is
    <programlisting>set grepprg=grep\ -nH\ $*</programlisting>

    The first window (shown as <literal>[Error&nbsp;List]</literal> above) is a

    reference. The cursor will be located in the first line of this window. The
    bottom window is a <literal>preview-window</literal> showing the context of
    the <literal>\label</literal>. Moving around in the
    <literal>[Error&nbsp;List]</literal> window automatically scrolls the
    preview window so as to always keep showing the context of the
    <literal>\label</literal> being viewed in the
    <literal>[Error&nbsp;List]</literal> window. You can also press
    <literal>J</literal> and <literal>K</literal> in the

   <para>
    To insert one of the labels, simply position the cursor in the correct line
    in the <literal>[Error&nbsp;List]</literal> window and press
    <literal>&lt;enter&gt;</literal>. This will immediately close the two newly
    opened windows, get back to the correct location in the original file being
    edited and insert the label into the <literal>\ref</literal> command. 
   </para>
   <para>
    If you notice carefully in the example above, the
    <literal>[Error&nbsp;List]</literal> window only showed the matches for the
    equations and did not list any of the figure labels. This is because we
    pressed <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> after <literal>\ref{eqn:</literal>
    instead of simply after <literal>\ref{</literal>. This caused &ls; to
    search only for those labels which started with the string
    <literal>eqn:</literal>. If you had pressed
    <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> after a <literal>\ref{</literal>, you would
    have been shown matches from <emphasis>all</emphasis> labels, not just
    those starting with <literal>eqn:</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Thus prefixing all your labels with <literal>eqn:</literal>,
    <literal>fig:</literal>, <literal>tab:</literal> etc. depending on what you
    are labelling will lead to an easier time completing references.

   <para>
    Any command which contains the pattern <literal>ref</literal> in it is

    <literal>\label</literal>'s.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you press <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> after typing

    <para>
     Often times, the editing cycle proceeds by first laying out a
     comprehensive bibliography and then completing all the
     <literal>\cite</literal> commands in one session. In such situations,
     it is inefficient to scan the whole list of bibliography files for
     bib-keys each time. &ls; provides a way to cache the results of the
     cite completion search using the <link
      linkend="Tex_RememberCiteSearch"><literal>Tex_RememberCiteSearch</literal></link>
     variable. If set, &ls; will perform the search only the first time
     <literal>&lt;F9&gt;</literal> is used. Next time on, it will reuse the
     search results. If you wish to redo the search results, issue the
     command
     <programlisting>TClearCiteHist</programlisting>

  <section id="compiler-rules">
   <title>Setting Compilation rules</title>
   <para>
    In order to compile &latex; files into various formats, &ls; needs to know
    which external programs to call and in which way they need to be called.
    This information is provided to &ls; via a number of "rules". For each
    format you want to compile to, you need to specify a rule. A rule is
    specified by defining a variable of the form:
    <programlisting>g:Tex_CompileRule_&lt;format&gt;</programlisting>
    where <literal>&lt;format&gt;</literal> is a string like
    <literal>"pdf"</literal>, <literal>"dvi"</literal> etc.
   </para>
   <para>
    Example: By default, &ls; uses the following rule for compiling &latex;
    documents into DVI.
    <programlisting>g:Tex_CompileRule_dvi = 'latex --interaction=nonstopmode $*'</programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    Default values are also provided for ps and pdf formats. You might want to
    change these rules in texrc according to your local tex environment.

    <para>
     For win32 users user MikTeX, sometimes the latex compiler's output has a

   <para>
    &ls; also handles compiling dependencies automatically via certain

    For example, if in your case, you use
    <programlisting>.tex -&gt; .dvi -&gt; .ps -&gt; .pdf</programlisting>
    to generate <literal>pdf</literal> files from <literal>dvi</literal>
    files, then you will need to specify the following setting in your
    latex-suite configuration (see <link
     linkend="customizing-latex-suite">customizing &ls;</link> for where
    these settings should go):
    <programlisting>
let g:Tex_FormatDependency_pdf = 'dvi,ps,pdf'
</programlisting>
    This is a comma seperated string of formats specifying the order in
    which the formats to be compiled into should be chosen.  With this
    setting, if you set the target format to <literal>pdf</literal>, then
    the next time you compile via the <literal>\ll</literal> shortcut, &ls;
    will first generate a <literal>dvi</literal> file, then use that to
    generate the <literal>ps</literal> file and finally create the
    <literal>pdf</literal> file from that.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>

    Often times the file you are currently editing is only a fragment being

    will need to do create a dummy file in the directory containing the
    current file. This dummy file is of the form:
    <literal>&lt;mainfilename&gt;.latexmain</literal>
   </para>
   <para>
    As an example, suppose you have the following setup:
    <programlisting>% file: main.tex
\documentclass{report}
\begin{document}

\input{chapter1.tex}

\end{document}</programlisting>
    In other words, even when you are editing <literal>chapter1.tex</literal>,
    you want to compile <literal>main.tex</literal>. In this situation, create
    a file called <literal>main.tex.latexmain</literal> in the directory
    containing <literal>chapter1.tex</literal> (and
    <literal>main.tex</literal>). After doing this, when you press
    <literal>\ll</literal> while editing <literal>chapter1.tex</literal>, then
    &ls; will compile <literal>main.tex</literal> instead. The
    <literal>.latexmain</literal> file can also be present in a directory
    directly above the directory containing the present file. &ls; will
    scan upwards recursively from the directory containing the present file
    and stop when it finds a <literal>.latexmain</literal> file, which
    points to the master file for the present file.

   <note>
    <para>
     Here <literal>main.tex.latexmain</literal> is (obviously) a different

  <section id="compiler-output-customization">
   <title>Customizing the compiler output</title>
   <para>
    Most &latex; compilers produce a very large amount of output during
    compilation, most of which is not relevant to debugging type-setting
    errors. The compiler plugin provided with &ls; (which is an enhanced
    version of the standard compiler plugin maintained by Artem Chuprina),
    provides a way to filter the compiler output so that the actual
    errors/warnings can be presented much more concisely.
   </para>
   <para>
    The compiler plugin is set up by default to function in a "non-verbose",
    "ignore-common-warnings" mode, which means that irrelevant lines from the
    compiler output will be ignored and some very common warnings are also
    ignored.
    &ls; does this via the global variable <link
     linkend="Tex_IgnoredWarnings"><literal>g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings</literal></link>.
    This is a list of patterns, which can be used to filter out (or ignore)
    some or the warnings and errors reported by the compiler. See the link
    above for its default value.
   </para>
   <para>
    &ls; uses the <link
     linkend="Tex_IgnoreLevel"><literal>g:Tex_IgnoreLevel</literal></link>
    setting to set a default ignore level. For example, for the default
    value of 4, &ls; ignores warnings and errors matching the first 4
    patterns in <literal>g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In addition to setting a default value of the ignore level, &ls;
    provides the ability to set the level dynamically, using the
    <literal>TCLevel</literal> command. For example, if you issue the
    command:
    <programlisting>TCLevel 3</programlisting>
    from within &vim;, then the next time you compile the document, &ls; will
    ignore warnings and errors which match the first three patterns in
    <literal>g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When TCLevel is called with the unquoted string strict as follows:
    <programlisting>TClevel strict</programlisting>
    then &ls; switches to a "verbose", "no-lines-ignored" mode which is useful
    when you want to make final checks of your document and want to be careful
    not to let things slip by.

    See the explanation of the settings <link
     linkend="Tex_IgnoredWarnings">g:Tex_IgnoredWarnings</link> and <link

  <para>
   Latex-suite ships with the plugin SyntaxFolds.vim which is a plugin for
   creating "fake" syntax folds on the fly. The fold method is actually manual
   but the folding is based on &latex; syntax. This offers a speed increase over
   regular syntax folding. Ofcourse it has the disadvantage that the folds are
   not dynamic, i.e newly created syntax items are not automatically folded up.
   (This is a compromise between speed and convinience).

    At this time, there is no setting available to tweak the folds which are
    created by &ls;. However, the folds created by &ls; are listed in
    <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/latex-suite/folding.vim</literal>. You will need
    to modify the function <literal>MakeTexFolds()</literal> defined in
    that file to modify the fold syntax. <literal>MakeTexFolds</literal>
    makes a number of calls to <literal>AddSyntaxFoldItem</literal>. Each
    such call defines a new "fold item". The order in which these calls are
    made defines how the folds are nested. For example, if you desire an
    <literal>figure</literal> environment to be nested within a
    <literal>section</literal>, then you should define the fold for the
    <literal>figure</literal> first. The syntax of
    <literal>AddSyntaxFoldItem</literal> is as follows:
    <programlisting>AddSyntaxFoldItem(startpat, endpat, startoff, endoff [, startskip, endskip])</programlisting>
    If the last two arguments are omitted, then they are assumed to default
    to the empty strings <literal>''</literal>.
    The explanation for each argument is as follows:

        actual fold end from the line satisfying <literal>endpat</literal>.
        <literal>startoff</literal> and <literal>endoff</literal> are
        necessary when the folding region does not have a specific end
        pattern corresponding to a start pattern. for example in &latex;,
        <literal>\section{Section Name}</literal> defines the beginning of
        a section, but there is no command which specifically ends a
        section. Thus a <literal>\section</literal>  is assumed to end 1
        line <emphasis>before</emphasis> another section starts.

        A Pattern Which Defines The Beginning Of A "Skipped" Region.

        For example, suppose we define a \itemize fold as follows:
        <programlisting><literal>startpat</literal> =  '^\s*\\item',
<literal>endpat</literal> = '^\s*\\item\|^\s*\\end{\(enumerate\|itemize\|description\)}',
<literal>startoff</literal> = 0,
<literal>endoff</literal> = -1</programlisting>

        This defines a fold which starts with a line beginning with an
        <literal>\item</literal> and ending one line before a line beginning with an
        <literal>\item</literal> or <literal>\end{enumerate}</literal> etc.

        Then, as long as <literal>\item</literal>'s are not nested things are fine.
        However, once items begin to nest, the fold started by one
        <literal>\item</literal> can end because of an
        <literal>\item</literal> in an <literal>\itemize</literal>
        environment within this <literal>\item</literal>. i.e, the following can happen:

        <programlisting>\begin{itemize}
\item Some text                         &lt;------- fold will start here
This item will contain a nested item
\begin{itemize}                         &lt;----- fold will end here because next line contains \item...
\item Hello  
\end{itemize}                           &lt;----- ... instead of here.
\item Next item of the parent itemize  
\end{itemize}</programlisting>

        Therefore, in order to completely define a folding item which
        allows nesting, we need to also define a "skip" pattern.
        <literal>startskip</literal> and end skip do that.
        Leave '' when there is no nesting.

    <para>
     A syntax fold region for the latex section is defined with the
     following arguments to <literal>AddSyntaxFoldItem</literal>:
     <programlisting>startpat = "\\section{"
endpat   = "\\section{"
startoff = 0
endoff   = -1
startskip = ''
endskip = ''</programlisting>
     Note that the start and end patterns are thus the same and
     <literal>endoff</literal> has a negative value to capture the effect
     of a section ending one line before the next starts.

   <title>&ls; Maps</title>
   <anchor id="remapping-latex-suite-keys" />
   <para>
    Most of the mappings used in &ls; can be mapped to a different key
    combination to suit your particular needs. An example best explains the
    procedure for doing this. Suppose you want to remap the
    <literal>&lt;C-j&gt;</literal> key which &ls; (actually imaps.vim) uses
    to jump to the next placeholder. To do this, you first need to find out
    which <literal>&lt;Plug&gt;</literal> mapping
    <literal>&lt;C-j&gt;</literal> is derived from. You will need to look
    at the relevant section of this manual to do this. For example, the
    section <link linkend="customize-imap-maps">IMAP mappings</link> has
    the information that the <literal>&lt;C-j&gt;</literal> key is derived
    from <literal>&lt;Plug&gt;IMAP_JumpForward</literal>. Therefore to
    remap the <literal>&lt;C-j&gt;</literal> key to say
    <literal>&lt;C-space&gt;</literal>, you will need to put a
    statement like the following in your <literal>~/.vimrc</literal>.
    <programlisting>imap &lt;C-space&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;IMAP_JumpForward</programlisting>
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     To change the <literal>IMAP</literal> mappings which affect jumping
     between placeholders, the <literal>map</literal> statement above has
     to be placed in your <literal>~/.vimrc</literal>. For other mappings
     you can place the <literal>map</literal> statement in your
     <literal>$VIM/ftplugin/tex.vim</literal> file.  The reason for this is
     that the <literal>&lt;C-j&gt;</literal> maps are created in
     <literal>plugin/imaps.vim</literal>, which is sourced as soon as &vim;
     starts before sourcing any ftplugin files.

    <title>Tex_Env_name</title>
     <para>
      If you wish to wish to expand certain environments differently from
      the way &ls; does it, you can define custom expansions using global
      variables of the form <literal>Tex_Env_{name}</literal> where
      <literal>name</literal> corresponds to the environment. This
      over-riding setting only works for Methods 1-3 described in the
      section <link linkend="insert-mode-environment-mappings"
       endterm="insert-mode-environment-mappings.title"></link>.
      In the future, it will work with the fourth method too.
     </para>
     <para>
      For example, if you press <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> after typing
      <literal>theorem</literal>, &ls; will by default expand it to
      <programlisting>\begin{theorem}
     \label{&ph;}&ph;
\end{theorem}&ph;</programlisting>
       However, if you wish change this to
      <programlisting>\begin{theorem}
     &ph;
\end{theorem}&ph;</programlisting>
       then define the following variable
      <programlisting>let g:Tex_Env_theorem = "\\begin{theorem}\&lt;CR&gt;&ph;\&lt;CR&gt;\\end{theorem}"</programlisting>
      </para>
     <para>
      If the expaniosn uses special keys such as carriage return etc, then
      use double-quotes and use the <literal>"\&lt;key&gt;"</literal>
      notation for special keys. Backslashes have to be doubled.
     </para>
     <para>
      You could even use strings returned by functions as the expansion by
      using the <link

      function.
     </para>
     <para>
      If the name of the environment contains special characters (for
      example, the <literal>eqnarray*</literal> environment), then use the
      following form:
      <programlisting>let g:Tex_Env_{'eqnarray*'} = 
        \ "\\begin{eqnarray*}\&lt;CR&gt;&ph; &amp;=&amp; &ph;\&lt;CR&gt;\\end{eqnarray*}&ph;"</programlisting>
       This will make pressing <literal>&lt;F5&gt;</literal> after
       <literal>eqnarray*</literal> expand to

     expansios from the default values in &ls;, you will need to define
     variables of the form <literal>g:Tex_Com_{name}</literal> where

     setting
     <programlisting>let g:Tex_Com_frac = "\\frac{&ph;}{&ph;}&ph;"</programlisting>

     However, the <literal>TexFoldTextFunction()</literal> is still available
     in case you want to use another folding scheme but still want to continue
     using the fold text function.

   A large number of functions in latex-suite come from various other people.
   Some of those people might have been missed here. Each function should however
   have the author's name/e-mail above it. Thats the more authoritative place to
   check out who has done what.
