# remove a few problems with the output of the latex compiler.
# 1. sometimes the compiler splits a single linenumber into multiple lines.
#    therefore join lines when the first ends in '\d\+' and the second starts
#    with the same
# 2. sometimes there are more than 2 closing or opening brackets in the
#    same line. vim's 'efm' cannot handle the case where multiple files
#    have to be popped in the same line. therefore if a line has more than
#    1 ( or), push them to the next line.
